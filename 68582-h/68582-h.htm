<h2 class="nobreak" id="PREFACE">PREFACE</h2>

</div>

<p>An historian of just pre-eminence in his university and
college, in a little work which should be more widely
known, has summed up the two principal characters of
the Revolution in the following phrases: “the cold and
ferocious Robespierre, the blatant Danton.”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The judgment
is precipitate and is tinged with a certain bias.</p>

<p>An authority of still greater position prefaces his notebook
on the Revolution by telling us that he is going
to describe the beast.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The learned sectarian does not
conceal from his readers the fact that a profound analysis
had led to a very pronounced conviction. So certain is
he of his ground, that he treats with equal consideration
the evidence of printed documents, of autograph letters,
and of a chance stranger speaking in a country inn of
a thing that had happened forty years before.</p>

<p>The greatest of French novelists and a principal poet
has given us in “Quatre-vingt-treize” a picture moving
and living. Yet even in that work much is admitted, for
the sake of contrast and colour, which no contemporary
saw. The dialogue between Danton and Marat, with its
picturesque untruths, is an example.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a></p>

<p>If facts so conflicting be stated as true by men of
such various calibre, it would seem a very difficult task
to write history at all. Yet there is a method which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_viii"></a>[viii]</span>
neither excludes personal conviction, nor necessitates the
art of deceit, nor presupposes a primitive ignorance.</p>

<p>It is to ascertain what is positively known and can be
proved, and with the facts so gathered—only with these—to
paint a picture as vivid as may be; on a series of
truths—with research it grows to respectable proportions—to
base a conviction, general, wide, and capable of constant
application, as to the character of a period or of a man.</p>

<p>Such was the method of Fustel de Coulanges, and on
his model there has arisen from the minute, the sometimes
pedantic accuracy of French scholars, a school
which is the strongest in Europe.</p>

<p>The method I have been describing has also this
advantage, that the least learned may enter upon such a
path without confusion and may progress, and that a
book of no pretensions can yet, by following these rules,
at least avoid untruth. With inferior tools, and on an
over-rough plan, I shall yet attempt in this life of Danton
to follow the example.</p>

<p>The motto which is printed at the head of this book,
and which is borrowed from the most just of biographers,
must give a note to the whole of my description. What
was the movement which founded our modern society?
what were its motives, its causes of action, its material
surroundings? And what was the man who, above all
others, represented that spirit at its most critical moment?</p>

<p>To find a right answer to such questions it is necessary
to do two things.</p>

<p>First, we must make the sequence of cause and effect
reasonable. In giving an explanation or in supposing a
motive, we must present that which rational men, unbiassed,
will admit. To put in the same character irreconcilable
extremes is to leave no picture. To state a
number of facts so that no thread connects them, so that
they surprise by contrast but leave only confusion in the
mind, is a kind of falsehood. It is the method most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_ix"></a>[ix]</span>
adopted by partisans; they frame a theory upon the
lines of which such and such facts will lie, but they omit,
or only mention as anomalies, facts which are equally
true, but which would vitiate their conclusions. We must
(to use a mathematical metaphor) <i>integrate</i> the differentials
of history; make a complete and harmonious whole
of a hundred aspects; strike a curve which shall unite in
a regular fashion what has appeared as a number of
scattered points. Till we can say, “This man—seeing all
his character and innumerable known acts—<i>could not</i> have
acted as such and such a report would have us believe;”
or again, till we can say, “This epoch, with its convictions,
its environment, its literature, <i>could not</i> have felt the
emotions which such and such an historian lends it,”—till
we can say this, we do not understand a personality
or a period.</p>

<p>In the second place, we must recognise in all repeated
and common expressions of conviction, and in all the
motives of a time of action, some really existing ideal.
There was a conviction common to many thousands of
Parliamentarians in the earlier stages of the English Civil
War. There was a genuine creed in the breasts of the
well-paid Ironsides of its later period. There was a real
loyalty and an explicable theory of kingship in the camp
of Charles the First.</p>

<p>So in the period of which we deal there was a clear
doctrine of political right, held by probably the strongest
intellects, and defended by certainly the most sustained
and enthusiastic courage that ever adorned a European
nation. We must recognise the soul of a time. For
were there not a real necessity for sympathy with a
period which we study, were it possible for us to see
entirely from without, with no attempt to apprehend
from within, then of many stupendous passages in history
we should have to assert that all those who led were
scoundrels, that all their lives were (every moment of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_x"></a>[x]</span>
them) a continuous piece of consummate acting; that
our enemies, in fine, were something greater and more
wicked than men. We should have to premise that all
the vigour belonged to the bad, and all the ineptitude to
the good, and separate humanity into two groups, one of
righteous imbeciles, and the other of genius sold to hell.
No one would wish, or would be sincerely able to place
<i>himself</i> in either category.</p>

<p>We must postulate, then, of the Revolution that which
Taine ridiculed, that for which Michelet lived, and that
which Carlyle never grasped—the Revolutionary idea.
And we must read into the lives of all the actors in that
drama, and especially of the subject of this book, some
general motive which is connected with the creed of the
time. We must make his actions show as a consonant
whole—as a man’s—and then, if possible, determine his
place in what was not an anarchic explosion, but a regular,
though a vigorous and exceedingly rapid development.</p>

<p>A hundred difficulties are at once apparent in undertaking
a work of this nature. It is not possible to give
a detailed history of the Revolution, and yet many facts
of secondary importance must be alluded to. It is necessary
to tell the story of a man whose action and interest,
nay, whose whole life, so far as we know it, lies in less
than five years.</p>

<p>Danton’s earlier life is but a fragmentary record, collected
by several historians with extreme care, and only
collected that it may supplement our knowledge of his
mature career. The most laborious efforts of his biographers
have found but a meagre handful of the facts
for which they searched; nor does any personal inquiry
at his birthplace, from what is left of his family or in
his papers, augment the materials: the research has been
thoroughly and finally made before this date, and its
results, such as they are, I have put together in the
second chapter of this book.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xi"></a>[xi]</span></p>

<p>He does not even, as do Robespierre, Mirabeau, and
others, occupy the stage of the Revolution from the first.</p>

<p>Till the nation is attacked, his rôle is of secondary
importance. We have glimpses more numerous indeed,
and more important, of his action after than before 1789.
But it is only in the saving of France, when the men of
action were needed, that he leaps to the front. Then,
suddenly, the whole nation and its story becomes filled
with his name. For thirteen months, from that 10th of
August 1792, which he made, to the early autumn of the
following year, Danton, his spirit, his energy, his practical
grasp of things as they were, formed the strength of
France. While the theorists, from whom he so profoundly
differed, were wasting themselves in a kind of
political introspection, he raised the armies. When the
orators could only find great phrases to lead the rage
against Dumouriez’ treason, he formed the Committee to
be a dictator for a falling nation. All that was useful in
the Terror was his work; and if we trace to their very
roots the actions that swept the field and left it ready
for rapid organisation and defence, then at the roots we
nearly always find his masterful and sure guidance.</p>

<p>There are in the Revolution two features, one of
which is almost peculiar to itself, the other of which is
in common with all other great crises in history.</p>

<p>The first of these is that it used new men and young
men, and comparatively unknown men, to do its best
work. If ever a nation called out men as they were,
apart from family, from tradition, from wealth, and from
known environment, it was France in the Revolution.
The national need appears at that time like a captain in
front of his men in a conscript army. He knows them
each by their powers, character, and conduct. But they
are in uniform; he cares nothing for their family or their
youth; he makes them do that for which each is best
fitted. This feature makes the period unique, and it is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xii"></a>[xii]</span>
due to this feature that so many of the Revolutionary
men have no history for us before the Revolution. It is
this feature which makes their biographies a vividly concentrated
account of action in months rather than in
years. They come out of obscurity, they pass through
the intense zone of a search-light; they are suddenly
eclipsed upon its further side.</p>

<p>The second of these features is common to all moments
of crisis. Months in the Revolution count as years, and
this furnishes our excuse for giving as a biography so
short a space in a man’s life. But it is just so to do.
In every history a group of years at the most, sometimes
a year alone, is the time to be studied day by day. In
comparison with the intense purpose of a moment whole
centuries are sometimes colourless.</p>

<p>Thus in the political history of the English thirteenth
century, the little space from the Provisions of Oxford
to the battle of Evesham is everything; in the study
of England’s breach with the Continental tradition, the
period between the Ridolphi plot and the Armada; in
the formation of the English oligarchy, the crisis of April
to December 1688.</p>

<p>This second feature, the necessity for concentration,
would excuse a special insistence on the two years of
Danton’s prominence, even if his youth were better known.
The two conditions combined make imperative such a
treatment as I have attempted to follow.</p>

<p>As to authorities, three men claim my especial gratitude,
for the work in this book is merely a rearrangement
of the materials they have collected. They are Dr. Bougeart,
who is dead (and his clear Republicanism brought
upon him exile and persecution); M. Aulard, the greatest
of our living writers on the Revolutionary period; and
Dr. Robinet, to whose personal kindness, interest, and
fruitful suggestion I largely owe this book. The keeper
of the Carnavalet has been throughout his long and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_xiii"></a>[xiii]</span>
laborious life the patient biographer of Danton, and little
can now be added to the research which has been the
constant occupation of a just and eminent career.</p>

<p>We must hope, in spite of his great age, to have from
his hands some further work; for he is one of those
many men who have given to the modern historical
school of France, amid all our modern verbiage and compromise,
the strength of a voice that speaks the simple
truth.</p>

she writes during the Empire to the two boys, Danton’s sons: she says “I am

<h1><span class="smaller">THE</span><br />
LIFE OF DANTON</h1>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_I">CHAPTER I<br />
<span class="smaller">THE REVOLUTION</span></h2>

</div>

<p>Before writing a life of Danton in English it is necessary
to do three things. First, to take a definite point of
view with regard to the whole revolutionary movement;
secondly, to explain, so far as is possible, the form which
it took in France; thirdly, to show where Danton stood
in the scheme of events, the nature of his personality,
the effects of his brief action. This triple task is necessary
to a book which, but for it, would be only a string
of events, always confused, often without meaning.</p>

<p>What was the Revolution? It was essentially a
reversion to the normal—a sudden and violent return to
those conditions which are the necessary bases of health
in any political community, which are clearly apparent in
every primitive society, and from which Europe had been
estranged by an increasing complexity and a spirit of
routine.</p>

<p>It has never been denied that the process of gradual
remoulding is a part of living, and all admit that the
State (which lives like any other thing) must suffer
such a process as a condition of health. There is
in every branch of social effort a necessity for constant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2"></a>[2]</span>
reform and check: it is apparent to the administrator of
every kind: it is the business of a politician continually
to direct and apply such correction:—the whole body of
the law of England is a collection of the past results of
this guiding force.</p>

<p>But what are the laws that govern it? What is the
nature of the condition that makes reform imperative?
What distinguishes the good from the bad in the matter
of voluntary change, and separates the conservative from
the destructive effort?</p>

<p>It is in the examination of this problem that we may
discover how great a debt the last century owed to nature—a
debt which demanded an immediate liquidation, and
was often only paid at the expense of violence.</p>

<p>It would seem that the necessity of reform arises
from this, that our ideas, which are eternal, find themselves
expressed in phrases and resulting in actions which
belong to material environment—an environment, therefore,
that perpetually changes in form. It is not to be
admitted that the innermost standards of the soul can
change; if they could, the word “reform” would lose all
moral meaning, and a thing not being good would cease
to be desired. But the meaning of words, the effect
on the senses of certain acts, the causes of pleasure
and pain in a society, the definition of nationality—all
these things of their nature change without ceasing, and
must as ceaselessly be brought into accordance with the
unchanging mind.</p>

<p>What test can be applied by which we may know
whether a reform is working towards this rectification
or not? None, except the general conviction of a whole
generation that this or that survival obstructs the way
of right living, the mere instinct of justice expressed in
concrete terms on a particular point. It is by this that
the just man of any period feels himself bound. This
is not a formula: it seems a direction of the loosest and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_3"></a>[3]</span>
of the most useless kind; and yet to observe it is to keep
the State sane, to neglect it is to bring about revolution.
This much is sure, that where there exists in a State a
body of men who are determined to be guided by this
vague sense of justice, and who are in sufficient power
to let it frame their reforms, then these men save a State
and keep it whole. When, on the contrary, those who
make or administer the laws are determined to abide by
a phrase or a form, then the necessities accumulate, the
burden and the strain become intolerable, and the gravitation
towards the normal standard of living, which should
act as a slight but permanent force, acts suddenly at a
high potential and with destructive violence.</p>

<p>As an example of the time when the former and the
better conditions prevailed, I would cite the period between
the eleventh and the fourteenth centuries, when a
change of the most fundamental kind passed over the
society of Europe, indeed a change from barbarism to
civilisation, and yet the whole went well. Reform, being
continual, was easy. New institutions, the Parliaments,
the Universities, the personal tax, rose as they were
demanded, and the great transition was crowned with
the security and content that surrounded St. Louis.
Simplicity, that main condition of happiness, was the
governing virtue of the time. The king ruled, the knight
fought, the peasant dug in his own ground, and the priest
believed.</p>

<p>It is the lack of simplicity that makes of the three
centuries following the fifteenth (with vices due perhaps
to the wickedness of the fifteenth) an opposite example.
Every kind of phrase, emblem, or cloak is kept; every
kind of living thing is sacrificed. Conditions cease to
be flexible, and the body of Europe, which after all still
breathes, is shut in with the bonds of the lawyers, and all
but stifled.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century one would say that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span>
political quarrels of the princes were a mere insult to
nature, but the people, though they are declining, show
that they still exist; the passions of their religions
enliven the dead game of the Tudors and the Valois.
In the seventeenth the pedants give their orders, the
upper classes fight the princes, the people are all but
silent. Where were they in the Fronde, or in that less
heroic struggle the Parliamentary Wars? As the
eighteenth century falls further and further into decay
all is gone; those who move in comfort above the souls
which they have beneath them for a pavement, the rich
and the privileged, have even ceased to enjoy their
political and theological amusements; they are concerned
only with maintaining their ease, and to do this they
conjure with the name of the people’s memories.</p>

<p>They build ramparts of sacred tombs, and defend
themselves with the bones of the Middle Ages, with the
relics of the saint and the knight.</p>

<p>It is this which necessitates and moulds the Revolution.
The privileged men, the lawyers especially, held to
the phrase. They excused themselves in a time most
artificial by quoting the formulæ of a time when life was
most natural and when the soul was nearest the surface.
They used the name of the Middle Ages precisely because
they thought the Middle Ages were dead, when suddenly
the spirit of the Middle Ages, the spirit of enthusiasm
and of faith, the Crusade, came out of the tomb and
routed them.</p>

<p>I say, then, that the great disease of the time preceding
the Revolution came from the fact that it had kept
the letter and forgotten the spirit. It continued to do
the same things as Europe at its best—it had entirely
neglected to nourish similar motives. Let me give an
extreme example. There are conditions under which to
burn a man to death seems admissible and just. When
offences often occur which society finds heinous beyond<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
words, then no punishment seems sufficient for the satisfaction
of the emotion which the crime arouses. Thus
during the Middle Ages (especially in the latter part
of their decay), and sometimes in the United States
to-day, a man is burned at the stake. But there are
other conditions under which a society shrinks with
the greatest horror from such a punishment. Security
is so well established, conviction in this or that so
much less firm, the danger from the criminal so much
less menacing, that the idea of such an extreme agony
revolts all men. Then to burn is wrong, because it is
unnecessary and undesired. But let us suppose the
lawyers to be bent on a formula, tenacious from habit
and become angrily tenacious from opposition, saying that
what has been shall be; and what happens? The Parliament
of Strasbourg condemns a man to be burnt while
the States General are actually in session in 1789!</p>

<p>Again, take the example of the land. There was a
time when the relations of lord and serf satisfied the
heart. The village was a co-operative community: it
needed a protector and a head. Even when such a need
was not felt, the presence of a political personage, at the
cost of a regular and slight tax, the natural affection which
long habit had towards a family and a name—these made
the relation not tolerable, but good. But when change
had conquered even the permanent manorial unit, and the
serf owned severally, tilling his private field; when the
political position of the lord had disappeared, and when
the personal tie had been completely forgotten—then the
tax was folly. It was no longer the symbol of tenure
drawn in a convenient fashion, taken right out of the cornfield
from a primitive group of families; it had become an
arbitrary levy, drawn at the most inconvenient time,
upsetting the market and the harvest, and falling on a
small farmer who worked painfully at his own plot of
ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p>It is difficult to explain to English readers how far
this deadening conservatism had been pushed on the
Continent. The constitution of England and the habits
of her lawyers and politicians were still, for all their vices,
the most flexible in Europe. Even Pitt could tinker at
the representative system, and an abominable penal code
could be softened without upsetting the whole scheme of
English criminal law. To this day we notice in England
the most fundamental changes introduced, so to speak,
into an unresisting medium: witness those miniature
revolutions, the Income Tax and Employers’ Liability,
which are so silent, and which yet produce results so
immeasurable.</p>

<p>It has always been a difficulty in writing of the
Revolution for English readers, that in England the
tendency to reform, though strong, was not irresistible.
It was a desire, but it was not a necessity, and that on
account of the quality which has just been mentioned,
the lack of form and definition in the English constitution
and legal habit.</p>

<p>But if we go a little deeper we shall see a further
cause. Nothing will so deaden the common sense of
justice in a legislator or a lawyer, nothing will separate
him so much from the general feeling of his time, as
distinction of class from class. When a man cannot frequently
meet and sympathise with every kind of man
about him, then the State lacks homogeneity; the general
sentiment is unexpressed, because it has no common organ
of expression, and you obtain in laws and legal decisions
not the living movement of the citizens, but the dead
traditions of a few.</p>

<p>Now by a peculiar bent of history, the stratification
of society which is so natural a result of an old civilisation,
was less marked in England than elsewhere in
Europe. The society of the Continent is not more homogeneous
to-day, as contrasted with that of modern England,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
than was the society of England a hundred years
ago, as contrasted with that of the Continent then; and
any English traveller who is wise enough to note in our
time the universal type of citizen in France, will experience
something of the envy that Frenchmen felt
when they noted the solid England of the eighteenth
century. There great lawyers were occasionally drawn
from the people; there a whole mass of small proprietors
in land or capital—half the people perhaps—kept the
balance of the State, and there a fluctuating political
system could, for all its corruption, find a place for the
young bourgeois Wolfe to defeat the great gentleman
Montcalm.</p>

<p>But while in England reform was possible (though
perhaps it has been fatally inadequate), in the rest of
Europe it was past all hope. Everywhere there must be
organs of government, and these on the Continent could
no longer be changed, whether for better or worse: they
had become stiff with age, and had to be supplanted.
Now to supplant the fundamental organs of government,
to make absolutely new laws and to provide an
absolutely new machinery—all this is to produce a violent
revolution.</p>

<p>You could not reform such a body as the Châtelet,
nor replace by a series of statutes or of decisions such a
mass as the local coûtumes. Not even a radical change
in the system of taxation would have made the noblesse
tolerable; no amount of personal energy nor any excellence
of advisers could save a king enveloped with the mass
of etiquette at Versailles. These numerous symptoms of
the lethargy that had overtaken European society, even
the disease itself, might have been swept away by a sharp
series of vigorous reforms. Indeed, some of these reforms
were talked of, and a few actually begun in the garrulous
courts of Berlin and of St. Petersburg. Such reforms
would have merited, and would have obtained, the name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
of Revolution, but they might have passed without that
character of accompanying excess which has delayed upon
every side the liberties of Europe. We should be talking
of the old regime and of the Revolution as we do now,
but the words would have called up a struggle between
old Parliaments and young legists, between worn-out
customs and new codes, between the kings of etiquette
and the kings of originality, between sleep and the new
science; the eighteenth and the nineteenth centuries
would have been united by some curious bridge—not
separated by an abyss.</p>

<p>As it is, the word Revolution recalls scenes almost as
violent as those which marked the transition of Rome
from the Republic to the Empire. We remember the
name not of Condorcet but of Marat: in place of the divided
Europe and complicated struggle which (on the analogy
of the Reformation) should have attended a movement
upon which sympathy was so evenly divided, in place
of a series of long, desultory campaigns, you have a
violent shock of battle between the French and every
government in Europe; you have the world outlawing
a people; you have, as a direct consequence of such a
pressure, the creation of a focus from whose extreme heat
proceeds the conquering energy of Napoleon. Blows
terrible and unexpected are struck in the first four years
of the war, and there appears in 1796 a portent—the
sword that was not broken until it had cut down and
killed the old society of the West.</p>

<p>To all these accidents which flow from the form the
Revolution took, one more must be added, and that the
most important. The shock was of such violence that
all the old bonds broke. I mean the permanent things
which hold society together, not the dead relics, which
would in any case have disappeared.</p>

<p>Many great changes have passed over Europe and
have left the fundamentals untouched; the Revolution,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
which might so easily have remoulded the shape of
society, did more and possibly worse: it rebuilt from the
foundations. How many unquestioned dogmas were
suddenly brought out into broad daylight! All our
modern indecision, our confused philosophies, our innumerable
doubts, spring from that stirring of the
depths. Is property a right? May men own land? Is
marriage sacred? Have we duties to the State, to the
family? All these questions begin to be raised. A
German Pole has denied the sequence of cause and effect.
Occasionally a man suddenly rises and asks, “Is there a
God?” There is nothing left in reserve for the amusement
of posterity.</p>

<p>Well, this unexampled violence, which, like the
wind on the Red Sea, has bared for a moment things
that had lain hidden for centuries—this war of twenty
years and its results were due to the fact that the
Revolution, which might have started in a different
form from almost any European centre, started as fact
from France.</p>

<p>That France was the agent of the reform is the
leading condition of the whole story, for it was her
centralisation that made the change so rapid and so
effectual, her temperament that framed the abstract formulæ
which could spread like a religion, her political
position in Europe that led to the crusade against her;
and this war in its turn (acting on a Paris that led and
governed the nation) produced all the further consequences
of the Revolution from the Terror to Waterloo.</p>

<p>Let us examine the conditions of the Revolution as a
purely French thing, see what it was that made it break
out when it did, what guided its course, what gave Paris
its position, what led to the wars and the Terror.</p>

<p>In the first place, the causes of the Revolutionary
movement in France. They were two: First, the immediate
material necessity for reform which coincided with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
the Revolutionary period; secondly, the philosophy which
had permeated society for a generation, and which, when
once a change was undertaken, guided and controlled the
development of that change.</p>

<p>As for the material circumstances that led to so
urgent a necessity for reform, they may be stated as
follows:—The governmental machinery, which had been
growing more and more inefficient, had finally broken
down; and this failure had been accelerated by a series
of natural accidents, the most prominent among them
being two successive years of scarcity.</p>

<p>Now why was France alone in such a deplorable
condition? Why was she all but bankrupt, her navy in
rapid decay, her armies ill-clothed, ill-fed, in arrears of
pay? Why could Arthur Young, observant, honest, and
inept, make his tour through France (in which the mass
of accurate detail is balanced by so astounding a misconception
of French society<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>), and in that book describe
the land going out of cultivation, the peasant living on
grass, the houses falling down, the roads impassable?
The answer is discovered in the very causes that led to
the past greatness of the country. Because France alone
in Europe was a vast centralised body—a quality which
had made the reign of Louis XIV.; because centralisation
could not continue to work under the old regime—a
condition which led to the abrupt wreck of 1788 and
1789.</p>

<p>The government of France, in the century preceding
the Revolution, might be compared to a great machine
made with admirable skill out of the disjointed parts of
smaller engines; a machine whose designer had kept but
a single end in view—the control of all the works by one
lever in the hand of one man. But (to continue the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
metaphor) the materials to which his effort had been
confined forbade simplicity; the parts would be repaired
with difficulty, or sometimes not at all; the cleaning and
oiling of the bearings was neglected, of necessity, on
account of their position; and after two generations of
work the machine had ceased its functions. It was
clogged upon every side and rusty—still dependent upon
one lever, but incapable of movement.</p>

<p>France had become a despotism, but a despotism
which lacked organisation; all centred in the king, with
the result that none could act but he, and yet, when he
strove to act, the organs of action were useless. All had
been made dependent upon one fountain-head, yet every
channel was stopped up.</p>

<p>It is of the utmost importance in studying the
Revolution to appreciate this fact: that nearly every
part of the national life was sound, with the exception
of the one supreme function of government. I do not
mean that France and the world needed no new ideas,
nor that a material change in the form of the executive
would have sufficed for society. But I mean that, more
than is usually the case in a time of crisis, a <i>political</i> act
was the supreme need of the moment.</p>

<p>Capital was not well distributed, but at least it was
not centralised as it is in our modern industrial societies.
All men owned; the peasant was miserable beyond
words, but his misery was not the result of an “Economic
Law;” it was due to that much more tangible thing, misgovernment.
The citizen was apathetic, but potentially
he was vigorous and alert. If he knew nothing of the
jury or of public discussion, it was the system oppressing
the man, not the man creating, or even permitting, the
system. In a word, the vices or the misfortunes of
France were not to be traced to the character of the
social system or of the national temper. They were to
be found in an artificial centre, the Government.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span></p>

<p>Now of all governments a pure despotism can most
quickly establish reforms. In Russia the serfs were
freed, the Jews expelled, by a stroke of the pen; in
India you may see great financial experiments, great
military groups, come into being almost simultaneously
with the decision that creates them. Why could not
the central government have saved France? Because on
every side its action was deadened by dead things, which
it pretended were alive; because throughout the provinces
and towns there lay thick the corpses of what had
once been local institutions, and because so far from the
Crown removing these, it had left to them the privileges
which at one time were the salaries of their activity,
but which had now become a kind of bribe to continue
inactive.</p>

<p>How had this come about? How had a government
been developed whose note was centralisation and despotism,
and which yet carefully preserved the fossils of local
administration?</p>

<p>To answer that question it is necessary to consider
the original matter of which French society was composed
and the influences that modified without destroying
this matter in the course of the Middle Ages. The
French, like every other national group in Western
Europe, may be said to have differentiated from the
mere ruins of the Empire in that dark period which
follows the death of Charlemagne; until that epoch
some shadow of unity remained, and certainly the forces
working against unity had not yet begun to be national.
The order of Rome, which had remained as an accepted
ideal for five hundred years, takes under Charlemagne a
certain substance and reality, as mystical and as strange,
as full of approaching doom and yet as actual as a
momentary resurrection from the dead. It ceases with
the close of his reign, and what Dr. Stubbs has well
called “the darkness of the ninth century” comes down.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span></p>

<p>The northern pirates fall on the north and west, and
cut off the islands from the mainland, giving us in England
the barrier of the Danish invasions, beyond which
Anglo-Saxon history grows dim; they crush out the
customs, and even the religion, of the coasts of the
Continent. The Hungarian certainly, the heathen Slavs
of the Baltic presumably, cut in streams through the
Germanic tribes. The Saracens held the Mediterranean.
Society fell back upon its ultimate units; in all that
mechanical disintegration the molecules of which it is
composed remained. The village community, self-sufficing,
self-contained, alone preserved an organisation and
a life.</p>

<p>For more than a century it hung upon a thread
whether the Roman tradition should survive, or whether
our civilisation should fall into the savagery which has
apparently been elsewhere the fate of systems almost as
strong. A new thing arose in Europe, destined more
than any other factor to deflect the current of its Latin
tradition. There was found, when the light began to
grow upon this darkness, in nearly every village a little
king. Whichever men had in the old times been possessed
of power, local officials, large owners of land,
leaders in the great armies, emerge from the cataclysm
welded into one new class—the nobles; and with the
appearance of this caste, with the personal emotions
and the strong local feeling that their system developed,
Europe becomes a feudal society. But that society
contained another element, which was destined to control
and at last to destroy the feudality. For strangely
enough, this period, which had thrown Europe into such
anarchy, had produced an idea the very opposite of such
a character. The nationalities begin to arise. The kings—weak
shadows—nobles, often of small power, but no
longer the mere leaders of armies, become symbols of a
local unit, separated from the Empire. They stood for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
the nation round which the patriotism that you will
discover in the old epics was to gather.</p>

<p>France, more perhaps than any of the new divisions,
illustrates all this. A small weak king, one Capet, was
elected from among the nobles at the end of the tenth
century, and the family which ultimately toppled over
from the immensity of its burden, descended from him
in direct line from father to son through more than
eight hundred years.</p>

<p>In the early years of that crusading century which is
the vigorous opening of the life that was to produce our
Europe, a discovery was made which was destined to help
this new kingship to take a very different shape. In the
loot of Amalfi, in a petty war, the Roman Code of Law
was rediscovered.</p>

<p>It had the effect which might be imagined in a
barbarous society which the Normans and Hildebrand
had at last aroused. It suddenly gave a text and an
accurate guide to those splendid but vague memories of
Imperial order and civilisation.</p>

<p>Everywhere the Universities arise; from Bologna
come out the corporation of the lawyers, the students
of the code, the men whose decisions were final, who
led mediæval society as the scientists lead ours to-day;
and everywhere they tended to the two bases of the
Roman idea—absolute sovereignty in the case of the
State, absolute ownership in the case of the Individual.</p>

<p>The logical end of such a movement should have
been the Empire—citizens all equal before the law, the
feudal system destroyed, the Church dominated by the
State, the will of the prince supreme. But Europe
contained a hundred elements beside the lawyers, though
these were the most permanent and active force of her
civilisation. The Manorial unit was strong; there are
places where it survives to-day.<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The aristocracy was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
strong. In Poland and England it ended by conquering
the Crown and the Roman law. The Church, affected as
it was by the new ideas, still had a host of anomalous habits
and institutions, grown up since the fall of the Empire.</p>

<p>In the anarchy of the dark ages the framework
of intense local differences had been constructed; the
village, the guild, the chapter, each had their special
customs born of isolation. Finally, the spirit of secondary
nationalities was powerful in many places; notably
among the Germans it conquered every other tendency.</p>

<p>Now France was especially favourable to the growth
of the influences of this law; she was very Roman by
tradition, and by tradition Imperial. Charlemagne had
left his clothes to Germany, but his spirit to Gaul. The
sub-nationalities, Provence, Normandy, the Gascons, had,
in spite of their local patriotism, epics in which they
harped on “Doulce France Terre Majeure.” But though
the national forces on the whole inclined towards the
lawyers and the Crown, the path by which absolute
centralisation could be reached was tortuous and had
to be well chosen. The nobles are slowly bereft of
political power, but their privilege remains; the peasant
gradually acquires the land, but many feudal dues lie
on a tenure which has lost all its feudal meaning. The
Church becomes the king’s, but it remains in administration
of its vast possessions: to the last the Crown
works through (or attempts to work through) the local
organisation that was once supreme and is fast dying.</p>

<p>You may compare the progress of the Capetians
towards absolute power to the action of a gentleman who
obtains an estate at the cost of perpetual bribery, and
finds himself crippled when he has at last succeeded.</p>

<p>Finally, the lawyers themselves become sterilised in
the general decay which their policy has created. Even
the Crown is half-allied to the privileged bodies in practice,
and altogether allied in sentiment; the government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
which had for centuries created and sustained the people
now found itself remote from them and the source of its
power cut off.</p>

<p>I will give but a couple of examples to illustrate the
centralisation and the hopeless confusion that accompanied
it. The first is from De Tocqueville. A village near Paris
wished to raise a small local rate to mend the steeple of
the church. They could not do so without appealing to
Versailles. The leave was granted after two years, but
the steeple had broken down. The second is from the
records of the election of ’89. In a bailiwick of Champagne
it was discovered that no one accurately knew the
boundaries of the district, that the next bailiwick was
similarly ignorant, and finally an arbitrary line was drawn.
This is one out of dozens of cases. The population of
Paris was not known; the number of electors in every
division was uncertain.</p>

<p>Such was the France in which reform was necessary.
The land, by a continual and misdirected interference with
exchange, was going out of cultivation—or rather (for
even in the worst cases of depression this symptom is
rare) it was yielding less and less as time went on.</p>

<p>The classes into which society was divided had become
separated by an etiquette as rigorous as a religion, and
though the thing has gone, the phrases that described
it are vigorous to this day, and lead continually to the
gravest misconception. A France where one Frenchman
has grown so like another still lets its literature run upon
some of the old lines.</p>

<p>Five great divisions should especially be noticed in
connection with the Revolution—the peasants, the artisans,
the middle class, the professionals, the noblesse;
and side by side with these, a separate thing, the Church,
sharply divided into the higher and lower clergy. Let
me, at the risk of some digression, enter into the details
of these various groups.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span></p>

<p>The peasants were the majority of the nation, as they
are to-day. At a rough guess, out of some five million
heads of families, three and a half at least were of this
class. What were they? They were more ignorant, more
fearful, and more unhappy than ever the inhabitants of
French soil had been before. I believe it is no exaggeration
to say that the worst of the barbarian invasions had
not produced among them such special and intense misery
as had the running down of the governmental machine in
the eighteenth century. Their songs had ceased. Search
the folk-lore of France, and you will find a kind of gap after
the centralisation was complete, and after the lords had left
them—after the seventeenth century. It is as though that
oldest sign of communal life, the traditions and the stories
of the little circle of the village, had died just before the
death of the village itself. As to religion, with which all
this natural and fertile love of legend is so closely knit, it
lingered, but it lingered hardly. The priest still survived,
but his action was cut off by penury; in places the extreme
physical needs of the peasantry, whose lot he shared,
entered into his life to an intolerable degree, and a half-paganism
resulted. Twenty, thirty pounds a year is not
enough for the celibate who holds the sacramental power
in the village. I will show you in the rural communes
of France church after church part of whose buildings are
very old, part very new: and what is the reason? That
in all these places the church fell into ruins till the new
State came to rebuild it. You may discover many cases of
restoration in the eighteenth century where a great cathedral
or a famous church or abbey is renewed: it is the work of the
upper clergy, and the dole out of their vast fortunes. In the
villages such cases are rare and eccentric. The Revolution,
for all its antagonism, gave to the Faith a new life. There
are to-day more monasteries and convents, more of the
clergy, both regular and secular, by far more missionaries,
than there were in 1789, but there are fewer bishops.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>The peasant owned land, his roof and a few acres
beside; he had been buying for generations, and the drift
of the law when it turned feudal tenant-right into ownership
was in his favour. But this ownership of the land,
the foundation of his future citizenship, was for the
moment his curse. It made him an independent man,
while he still had to pay the dues of his feudal dependence.
And independence works both ways. He stood,
ignorant and extremely poor, face to face with the all-powerful
State. His natural support and guide had left
the village for the court; the lord was nothing more than
a name for endless annoyance and local exaction. The
symptom that comes just before death showed itself in the
ploughman and the labourer in the vineyard. He lost
heart; he was too tired and too beaten to work; the great
burden of the State, its taxes, its follies, had accumulated
on his shoulders, and had bent them so low that he could
no longer stir the earth with vigour into harvests.</p>

<p>Such men did not make the Revolution; they were the
inert mass upon which it worked. They did not sing the
war-songs; they did not understand the meaning of the
invasions. No peasant marked the assemblies with the
sense or cunning of the fields, the sound of patois was
lacking in the great chorus, and as you read the Revolution
you feel continually the lack of something closely
in touch with Nature, because the most French of all
Frenchmen had forgotten how to speak.</p>

<p>The Revolution has made them; and to this day the
heirs of the Republic wonder at the peasant in his
resurrection. From him come the humour, the gaiety,
the manhood; it is his presence in the suffrage that
criticises and tones down the crudities of political
formulæ. He has re-created a host of songs, he has turned
all France into a kind of walled garden; underneath the
politicians, and in spite of them, he is working out the
necessary thing which shall put flesh on to the dry bones<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
of the Revolution,—I mean the reconciliation of the
Republic and the Church.</p>

<p>As to the artisans, they play in the story of the
movement a subsidiary but an interesting part. The
artisans (in the sense in which I use the term) were found
only in the great towns. At least the artisans outside
these centres must be reckoned as part of the peasantry,
for their spirit was that of the village. These craftsmen
of the towns did not form a large percentage of the nation.
Perhaps half-a-million families—perhaps a trifle more.
But their concentration, the fact that they could come in
hundreds and hear the orators, the fact that they alone,
by the accidents of their position, could form <i>mobs</i>, these
were the causes of their peculiar effect upon the Revolutionary
movement.</p>

<p>Like the peasant, the ouvrier gives hardly any type to
politics. If we except Hébert, on the strength of his
being a vagabond ticket-collector, there is hardly any one
of prominence who comes from the labourers in the towns.
But the combined effort of the class was great and was as
follows:—It furnished for the party of revolt an angry
and ready army of the streets; it was capable of follies and
of violence almost unlimited; it was capable also of concentration
and common action. It filled the tribunes of
the clubs, and more than once terrorised the Parliament.
It was patriotic, but wofully suspicious; and in all it did the
main fault was a lack, or rather a dislike, of delay, of self-criticism,
and of self-control: the ruling passion anger, and
the motive of this anger the partial information, the
extreme false idea, of the political movement, which it
was willing to read into every speech delivered.</p>

<p>I will attempt to say why this character, the worst
and the most dangerous of the period, was developed in
the labour of the towns. In the first place, the industrial
system is of itself fatal to the French character. It is not
in the traditions of the nation; it is opposed to the tendencies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
which the most superficial observer can discover in them.
The Frenchman saves and invests in small parcels, loves
to work with his own tools, is impatient of a superior
unless it be in some domestic relation, is attached to the
home life, and above all is no good specialist: “Il veut
rester homme.” You will find too many artists, too few
machines in a crowd of them.</p>

<p>It may be that a cheap distribution of power, or
that some other economic change, will reinstate the small
capitalist; till then, for all his industry, the French
workman will be at a disadvantage. In the great towns,
in the manufactory, under a central control which has no
political basis of right, cut off from the fields for which
the peasant in him always yearns, he is like good wine
turned sour.</p>

<p>In the second place, the system of the old regime
had produced an aristocracy of labour such as many
reformers demand in England to-day. Mediæval restrictions,
which had once applied to all workers, and had
been designed to limit competition between men all of
whom were employed, survived in 1789 as guilds and
companies strictly protected by law, with fixed hours of
labour, fixed wages—every kind of barrier to exclude
the less fortunate artisans. A system that under St.
Louis had made life more secure for all, had, under his
descendants, separated the workmen into two classes of
the over- and the under-paid, and these last increased.</p>

<p>In the third place, the recent treaty of commerce
with England had worked most disadvantageously for
French manufacture, and in all the great towns, especially
in Paris, thousands of men were out of work.</p>

<p>In the fourth place, the general scarcity of agricultural
produce struck the ouvrier, even if he were
employed at good wages, in the heaviest fashion.</p>

<p>Between the cornfield and the city came the taxes,
the feudal dues, the provincial frontier duties, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
finally the octroi paid at the city gates. So inept a
method of continually harassing exchange could not
but react upon production, and even when the harvest
was plentiful bread was dear in the great cities. Even
when these internal taxes did not diminish the output,
they raised the price in the towns.</p>

<p>Finally, the Church, which, as we have seen, had none
too firm a hold on the villagers, had lost all power over
the townsmen. To what was this due? Presumably
to the apathy which had overtaken the rich higher
clergy, a class which naturally congregated in the towns,
especially in Paris, and whose example influenced all
the surrounding priests. Add to this the destruction
of the old unit of the <i>parish</i> in the city. The industrial
system had broken up the neighbourliness of the capital.
Men rarely lived in their own houses, often changed their
lodgings to follow their work. There is no worse enemy
to the parochial and domestic character of our religion
than the economic change from which we suffer. Now
with the Church was associated all the morality of their
traditions; without it they were lost. They had not read
the philosophers; Rousseau had not permeated so deep.
For the matter of that, they would have cared little for
him or for Seneca; and, deprived of any code, they were
at the mercy of every passion and of all unreason.
Only this much remained: that they honestly hated
injustice; that egotism had very little to do with their
anger; that they were capable of admirable enthusiasms.
They had not the little qualities of the rich, and they
also escaped their vices. One great virtue attached to
them: they did nothing at the expense of the country’s
honour; no reactionary or foreigner bought them; they
were patriotic through all their errors.</p>

<p>To these characters, which they brought into the
Revolution, a further accident must be added. They
became disfranchised. As we shall see later, the constitution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
of 1790, based upon the very sound principle
of representing those only who supported the
State, gave no provision (as it should have done) for
making that support fall upon the shoulders of all. It
enfranchised the great bulk of Frenchmen—over four
million entered the ranks of the “Active Citizens”—but
it disfranchised the very class which sat in the galleries
of the Parliament or ran to the Place de Grève. The
workman, living in lodgings or flats sublet, often changing
his residence, rarely paid any direct tax; he alone,
therefore, lost the vote to which practically every peasant
was entitled. This accident (it was not planned) worked
in two ways. It added to the discontent of the Parisian
workman, but it also forbade his movements to take
political shape. To the very last the initiative was in
the hands of others.</p>

<p>These others were the three remaining divisions—the
middle class, the professionals, and the nobles.</p>

<p>It would be an error to make too hard and fast the
barriers between these classes. In the cart that took the
Dantonists to the guillotine all three were to be found.
Nevertheless it aids a history of the Revolutionary period
to distinguish each from each.</p>

<p>The bourgeoisie meant almost anything from a small
shopkeeper to a successful lawyer. It was not so much
the man’s occupation as his breeding and domestic surroundings
that made him of this rank. Let me explain
what I mean. Suppose the family of a linendraper (such
as was Priestley’s family or Johnson’s in England) possessed
of several thousand pounds. Let them put a son
to the bar, and let the son succeed at the profession; well,
the man and his son, so different in their pursuits, would
yet remain in the class I desire to define, unless by some
accident they got “in with” one of the literary coteries
with which the noblesse mingled. And this separation
would be something much more definite than in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
parallel case in England. This class of the bourgeoisie
stood like a great phalanx in the Revolution. Not one
in ten of the class I am attempting to describe had
entered the salons; there was not (as there is in an
aristocratic state) any great desire to know the noblesse.
An accident of surroundings, of eminence, or of friendship
might lift a man from this class, but he would leave
it with regret.</p>

<p>Of this class were Robespierre, Marat (in spite of his
aristocratic milieu), Bonaparte,<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> Danton himself, Santerre,
Legendre, Carnot, Couthon, Barrère—dozens of all the
best-known names in the second period of the Revolution.</p>

<p>Brewers, builders, large shopkeepers, a host of provincial
lawyers—these all over France, to the number of
at least a million voters, formed a true middle class such
as we lack in England. Note also that they might rise
to a very considerable position without leaving this rank.
A man might be physician to the first houses, a king’s
counsel, a judge, anything almost except the colonel of a
regiment, and yet be a bourgeois, and his son after him.
In the memoirs of the last century you will find continually
a kind of disgust expressed by the upper class
against a set just below them; it is the class feeling
against the bourgeoisie, their choice of words, their restrictions
of fortune, their unfashionable virtues. These men
were often learned; among the lawyers they were the pick
of France; they had a high culture, good manners, in the
case of individuals wit, and sometimes genius, but they
were not gentlefolk, and had no desire to be thought so.</p>

<p>Of those, however, who were technically bourgeois,
possessing no coat of arms nor receiving feudal dues,
some had practically passed by an accident of association<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
into the upper class of all. They met constantly in some
salon, library, or scientific body members of the privileged
order; their dress, manners, and conceptions were those of
the liberal noblesse. To such men, very small in number
and very influential, I would give the name of Professionals.
The class is complete if you add to it the many
noble names who stood prominent in the sciences or the
arts. It was recruited from legal families of long standing,
from financiers. It was polite, wealthy, often singularly
narrow. Of such a type were the Marquis de Condorcet,
Bailly, Sieyès; even Roland might be counted, though he
hardly stood so high. These were the theorisers of the
Revolution, with no practical grievance, ignorant of the
mob, despising and misunderstanding the bourgeoisie
(save in their political speeches); they were the orators of
the new regime, and died with the Girondins.</p>

<p>As to the noblesse (who partly overlapped these last,
and yet as a class were so distinct), they formed a body
with which this book will hardly deal, and upon which
I will touch but lightly. In very great numbers, the
bulk of them by no means rich (though some, of course,
were the greatest millionaires of their day), they were
defined by a legal status rather than an especial manner.</p>

<p>He was noble whom the king had ennobled or who
could prove an ancestry from the feudal lords of the
manors.<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> The family name was never heard, only the
territorial name preceded by the “de.” They had also
this in common, that the whole great swarm of families,
thousands and thousands, had a cousinship with that
higher stratum which made the court. This cousinship
was acknowledged; it put them in the army; it gave
them the right to be spitted in a duel, and, above all, it
exempted them from taxes. It made them, wherever they
went, a particular class, to be revered by fools, and able<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
to irritate their enemies merely by existing—a privilege
of some value. They held together in the heat of the
reform, and it was only from the higher part of the
noblesse that the deserters came—Mirabeau, Lafayette,
and De Séchelles. The great bulk of them were poor,
and consequently determined in the matter of privilege
and feudal right that gave them their pittance. The class
was richer than the bourgeoisie, but numerous families
in it had not the capital of a bourgeois household, and
many a poor lady boasts to-day of family estates lost in
the Revolution, whose ancestry had no estates at all, but
only a few tithes and a chance in the spoil to be had at
court.</p>

<p>Now to all these, without exception, reform seemed
necessary; it was only when the Revolution was in full
swing that the opposition of particular bodies appeared.
The peasant was in misery; the artisan was angry; the
middle class, possessed of that feeling which Sieyès expressed
in a phrase: “Qu’est-ce que le Tiers État?—Rien;”
and they were determined to work upon the
sequel: “Que doit-il être?—Tout.” To this general
chorus of demand the professionals added a strong conviction
(in the abstract) of the good of self-government
and of the necessity for removing State interference.
The noblesse, as a class, expected nothing in particular
to happen, but they were not unwilling for a Parliament
to meet; they also suffered from the extreme complexity,
or rather anarchy, into which things had fallen. Talent
saw itself wrecked by court intrigue; piety was offended by
the sight of a starving priest side by side with a careless,
wealthy, often irreligious member of the higher clergy.
Moreover, there ran through the nobility this curious
feeling—an error which you will always find in the more
generous of a privileged class—namely, that in some
mysterious way their special rights might be abolished
and they not suffer for it—as though there were some<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
vast sum in reserve, into which the State had but to put
its hand and relieve the poor without taxing the rich.
On the moral as on the material side this error obtained,
and Lafayette, a man created by privilege, thought that
when privilege was abolished his native virtues would
lift him into the first rank.</p>

<p>To all this attitude of expectancy, and to this instant
demand for reform, was added the insurmountable thing
that made the Parliament necessary. The great symptom
of decay had shown itself—the revenue could no longer be
raised. Luckily for France, there existed in the last century
no such international finance as exists at present,
and the fatal temptation of external debt was not offered.
With a population not quite two-thirds what it is to-day,
the country failed to raise one-twentieth of what it now
pays with ease. The debt was increasing with a terrifying
rapidity, and since all the methods of centralised routine
had failed, it was necessary to turn to the last resource,
and the nation was asked to vote a tax. With promises
of redress, with an understanding that the Assembly was
to reform upon all sides, with a special demand for a
statement of grievances, but especially for the necessities
of revenue, the States General were summoned for the
first time in a hundred and seventy-five years.</p>

<p>Such was the condition that preceded the Revolution.
We have seen the attitude of the various social classes
and the material necessity that prepared the reform.
Now what were the ideas that were about to guide it?
What theory was moving the men who met at Versailles?
What form would the national character give to the
changes which were in preparation?</p>

<p>It will be necessary here to propose a paradox. The
French character, which has been blamed so frequently
since the Revolution (and so justly) for an excess of
idealism, possesses at the same time a passion for the
positive, the objective, and the certain. In the same<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
man you will continually find some idea which pushes
him to extremes, and in the ordinary affairs of life a
most exact sense of reality, even sometimes an exasperating
accuracy of detail. They are not alone in discovering
an antithesis in the national character; in England, Germany,
or Northern Italy it would be equally possible to
show two apparently opposite characteristics united in the
same civic type. But perhaps the nearest parallel we have
at home to the contrasts of the French is to be seen in
the Scotch people; like the French, a nation of independents,
thrifty, investing continually in small sums, zealous
of pence; like the French, on the other hand, they delight
in the abstract problem; they will attach themselves to
some idea, and hold it to the point of martyrdom.</p>

<p>What was the result of these two tendencies? In
some characters they balanced each other. Condorcet
comes to the mind as an example. But, as with other
nations, the two aspects of France appeared (in much
the greater number of her citizens) exalted to a violent
degree that corresponded with the extreme danger and
the extreme hopes of a moment of crisis.</p>

<p>I do not mean that you would have found in France
two factions, the one of visionaries, the other of practical
men; I mean that throughout the Revolution the goal
and the method of attaining it reflected this double
nature. Consider the decrees and their effects. At
the sight of what the Assemblies from 1789 to 1795
are trying to do you would say, “A set of men attempting
to build a city of dreams;” there is hardly anything
so unnatural but that they will attempt it; they are ready
to reconstruct from the foundation. The most violent
period, that of 1794, is nothing but an effort to make all
men conform to civic virtue and believe the necessary
things; the most sane, that of 1791, is yet an attempt
to realise in the State an equality and a justice that can
only exist in the soul.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span></p>

<p>But if you turn to their methods and to the measure
of their success, then you have a very different idea.
They succeeded beyond all hope. They struck in a
few months the blows that remoulded all France. The
centralisation which the practical side of the character
had created was used to transform France as rapidly as
though the nation had been a household; and not only
do they find means to do this, but, when the necessity
arises, they suddenly raise armies of three hundred
thousand, of a million; they find the commissariat
somewhere in a starving people, and they succeed.</p>

<p>While, then, the nation was fitted for action to such a
degree, what was the theory which its idealism was about
to embrace? There had permeated throughout the
noblesse and the bourgeoisie something more than a philosophy.
It was not only a set of eighteenth-century
phrases, of Reason, and Nature, and Right, but all these
things turned into a religion. The apostolic quality of
Rousseau had touched the mind of France.</p>

<p>It is the fashion to belittle this man. Something in
him angers our successful and eager century, and yet but
for him our century would not have taken the shape it
has. It is needless to recall the movement which had
preceded and which surrounded him. He did but complete
the theory of the social contract; he hardly did
more than repeat the conclusions of the rationalists; in
the matter of economics he was entirely ignorant; he fell
continually into the error of superficiality where history
or where the details of institutions were concerned. A
resident in England, he imagined that her people were
represented; writing his famous work at Nuneham
Courtenay, he could not see that the squire was everything
in the little village. He had all the faults of
weakness; he invited a persecution which he had not the
wit to attack nor the stamina to sustain. What, then,
made him such a prophet? In the first place, the power<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
of words. All his critics in this country (with the
exception of Mr. Morley perhaps) have failed to appreciate
how great this power was. See what the Jacobean
translation of the Bible has done in England; note what
the pure rhetoric of Burke, proceeding solely from passion
and untouched by any movement of reason, effected in
England within a year of the fall of the Bastille: it was
this that Rousseau did in France. But not this alone.
If he possessed the power of words, he also had to an extraordinary
degree that other quality which does not reside
in style but in the texture of the mind. He could write
in the pure abstract, and produce a piece of clear exposition
deduced in an unbreakable chain from some fundamental
dogma. He never commits the error of supposing
his first principles to rely upon reason; he postulates a
Faith. He allows that Faith to illumine his every
sentence. He is certain that the things common to all
men are the things of immeasurable importance; he is
certain that the accidents of living are secondary. He is
certain that our being part of all nature is the condition
of happiness and of good; he is certain that the complexity
of living which separates us from Nature is an
evil, and to a France tortured with age he proposes
this simple water of youth: that it should return to the
first conditions of a small hamlet; where the families
met together dictate the law; where each sees himself to
be a part of the whole, and where the harmony that all
men sought comes easily to an ideal democracy hidden
in happy valleys. It is idle to argue that complexity was
there; that France could not have at once the patriotism
of twenty million, and the institutions of a hundred,
hearths. Every one saw that difficulty, and in the midst
of ’94 the most fervent apostles of Rousseau compromised
on the chief point, for the principle of election, which he
hated, remained of necessity the chief method in their
scheme of democracy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span></p>

<p>It is not the obstacles, but the motive force that you
must examine if you would comprehend the fervour of
the Republic. And the motive force was that passion
for the conditions under which the race has passed how
many æons of its tutelage, the harking back to the prehistoric
things, the village and the tribe, all of whose
spirit ran through the books that preached simplicity
with such admirable eloquence.</p>

<p>There remains one feature to be discussed before we
turn to a brief outline of Danton’s place in the movement—a
feature which will be of capital importance
throughout this book. That feature is the hegemony of
Paris. It was the rule of Paris that made the whole
course of the Revolution. In that focus of discussion
and of passion the great advances and the great blunders
of the Revolution took place. Paris alone made the 14th
of July, almost alone the 10th of August, alone and
against France the 2nd of June. Many an historian has
seen in her position an error that should have been and
could have been avoided. It is an opinion which from
the time of Mirabeau to our own day has lain in the mind
of French statesmen, that Paris must be jealously watched,
played, forbidden control.</p>

<p>Why does Paris hold this position? Here is a city-state,
eager, concentrated, the centre in many things of
our European civilisation; that it should continually
exert a moral influence over the State is easily to be
understood, but Paris did more—it conquered and dominated
the State, and France continually permitted that
leadership.</p>

<p>There is, I believe, a point of view from which this
historical fact becomes no longer an accident but a
reasonable thing; and if we take that point of view it
will be possible to understand why from the beginning
she preserved the initiative, and became and remained
till Thermidor the mistress of France.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span></p>

<p>The people of that country are, for much the greater
part, the peasants whom I have described. They have
for centuries been owners of the soil, and for at least two
thousand years (perhaps far longer) they have found all
their social, all their physical, and most of their intellectual
interests in the intense but narrow life of a
village community. In any great expanse of view you
see the white houses, all huddled together without
gardens, and between each group bare vast brown fields
empty of farmsteads. These peasants have in them an
admirable cousinship with the soil; their phrases and
their proverbs are drawn directly from the fields and
rivers; they are as healthy as Nature herself. Such is
the general mass of France; but these innumerable
villages, these vigorous swarms of men who work in the
sunlight, need a bond. Some concrete object must be
present to give true unity to many vague national impressions.
Something must be the <i>persona</i> of these
millions, and through the mouth of that something they
must hear action formulated, patriotism expressed, the
law defined. From it must come the executive, and of
it are expected the direct orders and the government by
which, in times of crisis, a nation is saved.</p>

<p>This brain, which is necessary to a complex organism,
might have been found in a high priest or a despot;
but we in England unconsciously look for it in an oligarchy.
Seeing the squires wanting, we think there is
nothing, and we draw doleful conclusions when we note
the absence in the French villages of the forces that
invigorate our own. We complain of the centralisation
that atrophies, forgetting the oligarchy that cows and
debases the inferior class; and while we despise the
political apathy of French country life, we ignore the
negation of society in our great cities.</p>

<p>The truth is that no definite system can escape
attendant evils, and that if one nation does not adopt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
the methods that have succeeded in another it is because
those methods are connected with instinct, and instinct
can neither be taught nor adopted.</p>

<p>It was instinct that forbade the growth in France
of oligarchic institutions. Everything was ready for it;
the feudal system would seem its proper parent; the
lords of the manors were so many seeds of what should
have been a territorial aristocracy. They were destined
to fail, and to say <i>why</i> is impossible, because it is impossible
to explain Nature; we can only feel. Something in
the genius of the nation makes for equality with the
depth and silence of a strong tide at night. It is not
the Roman law—all the nations had that. It is not
even the Church—there is a something in the Church
which neglects if it does not despise civic ideals. It is
not the distribution of capital—that can be distinctly
proved to be an historical result and not a cause. No,
it is not an exterior force, but something from within
which has produced this passion, the soul (as it were)
forming the body. “La France a fait la France.”</p>

<p>If aristocracy were impossible, what remained? The
walled towns. They are like pins on which the lace of
France is stretched; the roads unite them and make a
web which supports the rural communes. Never far
apart, always living a life intensely their own, the walled
towns stood guardian over surrounding villages. Here
was the cathedral or the abbey, the judges, the college.
It would give the name to a district, it would form with
its dependent communes a kind of little state. News
from the outside was concentrated here, and if a religious
or political enthusiasm ran from the Rousillion to the
Artois, it was not the villages that caught fire in the
mass, but the towns, that passed the message on like
beacons.</p>

<p>Now as the roots of this municipal system were to
be found in Rome, these needed a little Rome to cap it.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33"></a>[33]</span>
These towns being all of a kind, they of necessity fell
grouped under the largest of their class. The tendency
was well marked even before Gaul was re-united; the
same force that made the great archbishoprics makes the
metropolitan civil influence. Thus Rheims, Lyons,<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> and
Toulouse stand out hierarchically the heads of provinces—a
very different kind of town from Canterbury (let us
say) or Lichfield, where once they talked of an archbishopric
for Mercia.</p>

<p>Well, as the power of the Crown increases (which is
another way of saying, “as the nation realises its memories
of unity”), there increase with it the means of communication,
and especially the strong centralised system
which, as we have seen in another part of this chapter,
had become a fatal necessity to France. Remember also
that till the very end of the seventeenth century Paris had
been uniquely the king’s town, and had so been (with
one short interval) for more than a thousand years.
Here was every single organ which the executive of a
centralised government may need, and (what is more
important) here was the place where each organ had grown;
they were in the fibre of the place. Even if we go back
no farther than the Capetians, we have a full seven hundred
years of development in one spot from the familiar
domestic origins, the little barbarous court in the palace
on the island to the great city of nearly a million souls,
whose terms and professions and classes, and whose every
institution had developed round the throne.</p>

<p>When one remembers that the king had abandoned
Paris but a hundred years; that he had left in the capital
by far the greater part of the central machinery, especially
the lawyers; that even from what he had taken
many relics remained, and that professional men of all
classes had the family tradition of the court in the capital—then<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_34"></a>[34]</span>
we can understand what Paris was, is, and must
be to a France where no class is permitted to govern.
Add to this the increasing specialisation of function as
the organism develops—the concentration of the brain—and
Paris of the eighteenth century, abandoned as it is,
hurt in its dignity, and a little uncertain of its action,
still fulfils the geography-books, and is the capital of
France.</p>

<p>She herself hardly knew how certainly power would
fall into her hands, yet from the first mention of the
States General it was fated.</p>

<p>This, then, is the position as the States General meet.
A nation in absolute material need of reform, that must
have new institutions, especially new financial institutions,
or die; classes separate from each other, mutually ignorant
of each other, yet all in some degree feeling the position
into which France had fallen: in the case of the bulk of
the people, misgovernment appearing in the form of starvation;
in the case of the upper classes and of the government
itself, a conviction that the existing system was
contrary to all reason and opposed to every sound interest.</p>

<p>In this society, at least in that part of it that will be
called upon to govern, is a conviction—a religion, if you
will—whose basis was the faith of Rousseau. Conditions
will moderate this for a time; the necessary compromise
with what exists, the desire for peace that was uppermost
in the first two years, will make men slow to uproot and
destroy what may touch the interests of friends and of
large classes. They will always attempt a legal though
a rapid reform. But, in spite of them, on account of that
passionate conviction which underlay their most moderate
actions, the Revolution will move up towards the region of
unattainable things. The reformer will give way to the
Republican idealist when once the serious opposition of
the court is felt; he in his turn will give way to the man
of passion and of action when the country is in danger;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_35"></a>[35]</span>
and even the man of passion and of action—the man
of realities—will give way to the mere visionary before
reaction can come to sweep the floor clean in 1794.</p>

<p>Such will be the phases through which the form of the
Revolution will pass. As for the soul of it, France will be
steadily transformed, and, in spite of visionaries, reactions,
and every political accident, a new and a strong society
will be created. So the salt water comes in through old
dykes; on its surface you will note the phases of a flood,
innumerable little streams, a torrent, a spreading lake, and
ultimately calm, but only one thing all the while is happening—where
there has been land there will be the sea.</p>

<p>What place did Danton take in this transformation?
Of his opinions in detail, his habit of body and mind, his
convictions, the accidents of his life, it is the purport of
this biography to treat. I will attempt only a very brief
description of his position, to make clear the drift of his
Revolutionary career, and with this close a chapter whose
only object has been to describe the surroundings of a
character with which the rest of this book is concerned.</p>

<p>Danton belonged to the bourgeoisie in rank, to the
less visionary in the bent of his mind. A young and successful
lawyer of thirty, the Revolution found him unknown
to politics and not desiring election. It was the accident
of oratory that gave him his first position. He discovered
himself to be a leader, and there grouped round him a
knot of the most ardent, some of them the most brilliant,
younger reformers. The electoral district to which he
happened to belong became through him the most democratic,
and, in some ways, the most violent of Paris.</p>

<p>That part of him which led to such a position was his
sympathy. His tenderness (and he had a great share of
this quality) was hidden under the energy of his rough
voice, great frame, and violent gesture. His pity he was
slow to express. But the great crowd of men who were
unrepresented, the smaller but more influential class of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36"></a>[36]</span>
those who felt and knew but could not speak—these
were attracted to him because he had the instinct of the
people. He was a demagogue at moments and for a
purpose, but never by profession nor for any period of
time. What he was, however, all his life and by nature,
was a Tribune.</p>

<p>The secret workings of the soil, the power that makes
all the qualities of a nation from its wine to its heroes,
these had produced him as they produce the tree or the
harvest. He is the most French, the most national, the
nearest to the mother of all the Revolutionary group.
He summed up France; and, the son of a small lawyer in
Champagne, he was a peasant, a bourgeois, almost a
soldier as well. When we study him it is like looking at
a landscape of Rousseau’s or a figure of Millet’s. We feel
France.</p>

<p>His voice was a good symbol of his mind, for there
was heard in it not only the deep tone of a multitude,
but that quality which comes from the mingling of many
parts—the noise of waters or of leaves. In his political
attitude he attained this collective quality, not by a varying
point of view which is confusion, but by an integration.
His opinions erred on the side of bluntness and of
directness. They were expressed in plain sentences of a
dozen words; he abhorred the classical allusion, he was
chary of metaphor. He spoke as a crowd would speak,
or an army, or a tribe, if it had a voice.</p>

<p>This was Danton, the public orator and the Tribune,
who for two years was heard at the Cordeliers, who spoke
always for the purely democratic reform, who opposed
the moderates, and who helped to destroy the compromise.
Never identified with Paris, he yet saw clearly
the necessity of Paris. He admitted her claim, fenced
with her arrogance, but never worshipped her idols; once
or twice he even dared to blame her worst follies. Elected
to the administration of the city, he played but a slight<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_37"></a>[37]</span>
rôle, and until the spring of 1792 there is in him no
other quality.</p>

<p>The spring of 1792 produced the war with Europe,
and from that date Danton appears in another light.
Had he died then, we should have known him only
by chance references, a centre of strong reforming
speeches, an obscure man in opposition. But with the
outbreak of a war which he had done nothing to bring
on, and which his party thought unwise, Danton shows
that his character, in summing up his fellows, caught
especially their patriotism. France was the first thought,
and if we could hear not the debaters only, but all the
voices of France when the invasion began, it would be
this immediate necessity of saving the country that
would drown all other opinions. Thence, and for a full
year after, Danton becomes the leading man of France.
The ability which has led to his legal success (now that
his office is abolished and its reimbursement invested
in land) seems turned upon the political situation, and
such ability combined with such a representative quality
pushes him to the front. Two qualities appeared in him
which he himself perhaps had not guessed—the power
of rapid organisation, and the power of so judging character
as to bring diplomacy to bear upon every accident
as it arrived.</p>

<p>It was not strictly he who made the 10th of August,
but he was the leader. He saw that with the king in
power the Prussians would reach Paris, and more than
any man he organised the insurrection. That was the
one act of violence in his life.</p>

<p>The rest of the nineteen months that fate allowed
were spent in the attempt to reconcile and harmonise all
the forces he could gather for the salvation of the nation,
Perhaps it was his chief fault that in this matter he held
to no pure idea.</p>

<p>A Republican and an ardent reformer, he yet seems<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_38"></a>[38]</span>
to have thought France of so much the first importance
that he compromised and trafficked with all possible
allies. He attempted to stave off the war with England;
he attempted to keep Dumouriez; he tried to prevent
vengeance from following the Girondins; when the extremists
captured the great Committee, he acquiesced,
and still wrestled with the forces of disunion. He would
have hidden, if possible, those wounds which weakened
France in the eyes of the world, and he waged a futile
war with the pure idealists—the men of one dogma,
who in so many separate camps were destroying each
other for their civic faith, and preparing all the evils of a
persecution.</p>

<p>On another side of political action he appeared more
resolute than any man. It was he who saw the necessity
of a strong government, he who created the revolutionary
tribunal, and he who is chiefly responsible for the first
Committee of Public Safety. He made the dictatorship,
caring nothing for the principle, caring only to throw
back the foreigner. “He stamped with his foot, and
armies came out of the earth.” The violent metaphor
is just. There is a succession, a stream of great armies
(they say four millions of men!) pouring out from France
for twenty years. If you will glance at the head of that
stream, and wonder when you read of Napoleon what first
called up the regiments, you may see on the Champ de
Mars in ’92, and later demanding the great levy of ’93,
the presence of Danton, the orator with the voice of
command, the attitude of a charge, the right arm thrown
forward in the gesture of the sword.</p>

<p>Possessed of astounding vigour, but lacking ambition,
a lover of immediate but not of permanent fame, his
superb energy after a year of effort spent itself in a
demand for repose. In September 1793 he thought his
work done and his position secure. He went back into
his country home, walked in the fields he loved (and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39"></a>[39]</span>
which he talked before his death), revelled in Arcis,
filling himself with the convivial pleasure that he had
always desired. He came back in November secure and
happy—ready, almost from without and as a spectator,
to continue the task of welding the nation together. It
was too late. He had created a machine too strong for
his control. He had seen the Terror swallow up the
Girondins, and had cried because he could not save them.</p>

<p>With the winter he began his protests, his persistent
demands for reason and for common-sense; in the religious
and in the political persecution he called for a truce;
always his effort turned to the old idea—a united Republican
France, strong against Europe, with exceptional
powers against treason in a time of danger, but with a
margin on the side of mercy.</p>

<p>He failed. The extreme theorists whom he despised
had captured his dictatorship, and in April 1794 they
killed him.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE YOUTH OF DANTON</span></h2>

</div>

<p>I shall attempt in the following chapter to tell all that
is known of the first thirty years of Danton’s life. Our
knowledge of this period in his career is extremely slight.
It is based upon a minute research, but a research undertaken
only in the latter half of this century; and it is
to be feared that the scanty materials will never be
seriously augmented. Every year makes the task more
difficult, and a century has rendered impassable the gulf
which Michelet, Bougeart, and even Dr. Robinet, have
been able to bridge with living voices.</p>

<p>He was born at Arcis-sur-Aube,<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> a lesser town of the
Champagne Pouilleuse, that great flat which stretches out
from the mountain of Rheims beyond the twin peaks, till
it loses itself in the uplands of the river-partings. Here,
though it is cold in winter, there are still vineyards
making their last bastion on the covered slopes of the
hills that form the northern boundary of the plain.</p>

<p>The day of his birth was the 26th of October 1759;<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a>
the date gives us his relation to the drama in which
he was to be a chief actor. Five months older than
Desmoulins, born some months before De Séchelles, eight
years older than St. Just, he was the junior of Robespierre
by one and a half, of Mirabeau by ten years; Louis XVI.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_41"></a>[41]</span>
and Marie Antoinette were respectively five and four
years his seniors. He was sixteen years old when their
predecessor died in ignominy and in dirt. Born six weeks
after the fall of Quebec, he received the lasting impressions
of early youth during the rapid decline of the French
monarchy—the end of a slow decay which threatened to
be that of the nation itself. But just then Rousseau was
writing the <i>Contrat Social</i>, to be published in two years;
Voltaire was still in the full vigour of his attack, with
nineteen years of life before him; it was the year of Candide;
Diderot was founding the Encyclopædia.</p>

<p>The time of his birth coincided with the rising of a
certain sun which has not yet set upon Europe, but the
boy’s eyes turned to more immediate things, and saw in
a little provincial place the break-up of a wretched, experimental
reign.</p>

<p>This point must be insisted upon, that a country
town was the best possible place for noting the collapse
of misgovernment. The country manors were more
wretched, the provincial capitals more loud and able in
their expressions of opinion; but few places could show
the fatal process of disintegration more clearly than these
little provincial centres, the sub-prefectures of to-day.
The confusion of power, the excess and the ill-working
of privilege, the complexity and weakness of government,
were there apparent upon every occasion. The wealth of
the nation was diminished most especially by the interference
with exchange. This (though ultimately a
source of their penury) was less directly evident to the
villagers, while the large town with its varied production
could (in another form) disguise the evil; but to the
small borough the experience was direct and terrible.</p>

<p>Again, the practical equality of educated men was
there more apparent and more sinned against than in
the wider societies of the large towns. In a place like
Arcis-sur-Aube, isolated specimens of classes technically<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_42"></a>[42]</span>
distinct were continually in contact. The less the number
of their caste and order (and the less their importance),
the more do the noblesse, to this day, put on their pride;
and yet the more necessary is it, in the life of a small
town, that they should associate with those whose conversation
and abilities are precisely their own. In Paris
or in Lyons, where large cliques were occupied in general
interests, such differences were often neglected; in the
forgotten towns of the provinces never.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the blind and dumb anger of the
peasantry would hardly reach Arcis. All over France
the town misunderstood the countryside, and in the early
Revolution actually fought against it. This will appear
strange to an English reader, who sees scarcely any contrast
between a country market and an overgrown village.
In England the distinction hardly exists, but in France
the borough is very separate from the peasant society
outside, and, though often smaller than some large neighbouring
village, it keeps to this day the Roman traditions
of a city.</p>

<p>We see, then, that Danton’s birthplace in great part
accounts for the peculiar bent of his future politics:
practical, of legal effect, inspired by no hatred, though
strongly influenced by a personal experience of misgovernment.
But his parentage will show us still more clearly
how the conditions of his origin affected his career.</p>

<p>He was of the lawyers. His father was <i>procureur</i>
in the bailiwick of Arcis. It is difficult to explain the
functions of his office at this date and to an English
reader, for it belongs to that “Administration” which is so
essentially Latin, and which we are but just beginning to
experience in England. Let it suffice to describe him as
the <i>official</i> whose duty it was to supply that which in
England the <i>institution</i> of the grand jury still in theory
provides, as it did once in reality. It was his business to
“present” the cases and the accused to the local criminal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43"></a>[43]</span>
court—local, because in France the circuit of assize is
unknown. Added to this were many duties and privileges
of registration, of stamping and so forth; and the
position required an accurate, and even a minute knowledge
of the royal law and provincial usage, the complicated
customary system of the old regime.</p>

<p>It is perhaps of still more importance to appreciate
the social position of Jacques Danton. Belonging to the
lower branches of the legal profession, and placed in a
lesser borough of Champagne, the father of Danton held
something of the same rank as would a small country
solicitor in one of our market-towns, with whatever additions
of dignity might follow from a permanent office in
the municipality of the place.</p>

<p>As to fortune, we do not accurately know the amount
of the family income during Danton’s boyhood, but we
know that the office which was afterwards purchased for
him was worth some three to four thousand pounds; that
the money was found largely upon the credit of his
father’s legacy,<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> and that the house in which the family
lived was their own—a useful rule existing throughout
provincial France. It is a substantial building, among
the best of the little town, standing in the market-place,
with the principal rooms giving upon the public square.
What with the probable capital and the known emoluments
of his position, we may regard Jacques Danton as a
man disposing of an income of about four to five hundred
pounds a year.</p>

<p>His mother was of a somewhat lower rank. She was
the daughter of a builder from the Champagne, and
her brother was a master-carpenter of the town. Of
her two sisters, one had married a postmaster and the
other a shopkeeper, both in Troyes; her brother was the
priest of Barberey, near Arcis.</p>

<p>The father died when the boy was two and a half<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_44"></a>[44]</span>
years old, leaving four children. We must presume,
though we are not certain, that Danton had one brother:
and we know he had two sisters, one of whom married in
Troyes; the other died a nun at the same place in the
middle of this century.<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a></p>

<p>On both sides of his family, through the connections
and marriages of his relations, their employment, their
dwellings, their descendants, we see the origin of Danton
absolutely separate from the lower and from the higher
ranks of the old regime. Only by an effort of imagination
could he later understand the workman or the
peasant; only by daily conversation could he appreciate
the strange nobles of 1790, with their absence of national
pride.</p>

<p>In fine, Danton came out of that middle class which
has made the modern world, and which still insecurely
sustains it. “Respectability and its gig” is an epigram
that would exactly suit the dull and provincial surroundings
of his first home; but the converse of such provincialism
is sanity, order, and strength, and out of fuel
so solid and so cold the bourgeoisie has time and again
built a consuming fire.</p>

<p>From his father’s death, before he was three years
old, till his ninth year, the child was with his mother in
the house at Arcis, for she had from the little fortune
just enough revenue to keep the family together and to
educate the children. The little boy was taught his
Latin elements in the town, and then sent to the “Lower
Seminary” at Troyes.<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a></p>

<p>It was the intention of his uncle at Barberey to
make him a priest, and in that case he would have passed
through the regular stages, taking the higher forms in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_45"></a>[45]</span>
the Upper Seminary, and finally being admitted to orders
a year or two after finishing his “Philosophie.” However,
this programme was never completed, and the Church
lost in him the material for a vigorous, charitable, and
obscure country vicar.</p>

<p>The decision was probably the result of one of those
family meetings, such as were habitually held in France
to decide the career of an orphan child, and which the
Revolution raised to the dignity of an institution with
legal form. Some biographers have read the politics of a
man of thirty into the action of a little child, and have
made this step a precocious protest against clericalism.
These biographers have no children.</p>

<p>The uncle consented to the change, and, with Madame
Danton’s two married sisters, agreed upon the bar as his
future profession. He was sent to Troyes and placed
with the Oratorians, a religious order which has had the
honour of training so many of the great reformers. In
their College he went through that training which no
amount of social change or new theories in pedagogy has
been able to uproot from the secondary education of
France. Little Greek, much Latin, two years all employed
in the literature of the late Roman republic and early
empire—a groundwork in the elements which gives the
educated French an almost mediæval familiarity with
Roman thought; such was the course which the bourgeois
did and does go through in the French schools. A
system founded upon the humanities of the sixteenth,
but developed in the classicism of the seventeenth century,
it has lost the Hellenism, the subtlety, and the
breadth of the former, while it has preserved the rigidity,
the strength, and the clearness which the latter owes to
the influence of the Jesuits. It fails to develop that
initiative coupled with originality to which we in England
attach so much importance; it achieves, upon the other
hand, a strength in the convictions, and above all a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46"></a>[46]</span>
soundness in the judgment, which our public schools
often fail to produce.</p>

<p>From just such a curriculum came the exaggerated
classicism of Robespierre, the more brilliant but equally
Latin style of Desmoulins, though it must be admitted
that the first is a reminiscence of Cornelius Nepos, while
the second is at times well modelled upon Tacitus himself.
The error of such imitation, however, never marred
the speech of Danton in his later life; he owed this
singular freedom from the spirit of his age to travel, to
his vivid interest in surrounding things and men, and to
his intimacy with English and Italian.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a></p>

<p>Yet in a famous speech upon public education he
makes a just reference to the influence of this schooling
upon the mind of his contemporaries, and notes truly its
tendency to turn men republican.<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>Unfortunately he did not remain at such a school
long enough to receive its last and most beneficial impressions.
The head form at a French school is called
“Philosophie,” and the last year is spent largely in reading
the sociology and the metaphysics of the old world.
Danton left at the age of sixteen, when he had just completed
“Rhétorique,” but what he lost in polishing he
gained in being left to his own development for one more
year of his life than were his fellows.</p>

<p>Active, often rebellious, full of laughter, he showed
his intelligence in the final examinations, his vigour in an
escapade that endeared him to at least one of his school-fellows,<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
who has given us, with Rousselin, the only notes
we possess as to this period of his life. He ran off in his
last year to Rheims, seventy odd miles away, that he
might see the crowning of Louis XVI. Going and returning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_47"></a>[47]</span>
on foot, he satisfied the desire which he had expressed
to his school-fellows of “seeing how they made a king.”
So as a boy he went to look at the making of a king, and
afterwards, when he grew older, Danton himself unmade
him.</p>

<p>In 1780—his twenty-first year<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>—he entered the
office of a solicitor at Paris named Vinot. Apprenticed as
a clerk in order to read law, and above all to watch the
procedure of the courts, he spent the next four years in
preparing for the bar. If we are to depend on a chance
phrase dropped just before his death, he was at that time
entirely dependent on his master and his pen.<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> We know,
at any rate, that he received no salary, but lodged and
boarded with his employer; nor is it probable that he
received any money from home, for his mother had
married again, and a short time after this second husband
(a certain Recordain) was so deeply involved that
Danton was begged to hand over the most part of his
inheritance to save the family. He did so, and remained
with some five or six hundred pounds only as his share
of the family fortune. It was invested in land near
Arcis, and he kept it for his ultimate purpose of buying
a barrister’s practice in one of the higher courts.</p>

<p>He was called to the bar (a process in the same form
as taking a degree) in 1785,<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> choosing, with provincial
patriotism, Rheims as the place in which formally to
join the profession; but he intended to practise in the
capital, and returned thither at once.</p>

<p>It is not easy to render to an English public the
meaning of the various courts before 1789. Even in
France (so completely has the new order supplanted the
old anarchy) their forms have been forgotten, and
research purely antiquarian cannot give us more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48"></a>[48]</span>
disjointed particulars as to their procedure.<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> There was
a division corresponding to the English between Common
Law and Equity. This was to be discovered in every
country of the West, and had arisen of necessity from
the imposition of the king’s power and the Canon Law
over those local customs, mixed with reminiscences of
Rome, which had once been the whole life of the early
Middle Ages.</p>

<p>To the body of lawyers who in Paris (or in any of the
great centres) formed the courts for all ordinary pleas,
the name of “Parliament” was given. But that it comprised
more persons, that it never went upon circuit, and
that it included many barristers as well as judges, the
Parliament of Paris corresponded more or less to what
the English Bench would be were our judges to form a
kind of permanent council for advising the Crown and
registering its decrees, as well as for trying the cases
brought before them. To plead at their bar was no
difficult matter. It required but the taking of one’s
degree in law, and the fees of entrance were slight.
Danton determined to adopt this branch of the profession,
and to use it as a stepping-stone towards the higher
court, which he soon reached.</p>

<p>This higher court, “Court of Appeal,” as we should call
it, or “Cour de Cassation,” as it is named in the modern
French system, bore a title significant of the intense
conservatism of old France. It was called the “Court
of the King’s Councils”—very much what we should
have to-day in England had we preserved in fact the
theory that the king in his council is the final authority.
But though it bore a name drawn from the Curia Regis
of the thirteenth century, it had of course lost all its old
simplicity. It was a Bench like any other, but there<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_49"></a>[49]</span>
pleaded at its bar an order of lawyers strictly limited
in number and highly privileged.<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> It dealt, as did its
parallel in the English system, mainly with disputed
inheritances, especially in matters of land, and, as we
shall see, it showed the true mark of a court of Chancery,
in that it took more than a hundred and thirty years to
make up its mind. To plead before this court, with its
monopoly of valuable causes, was to have at once an
assured income and prestige; therefore its vacancies
were prizes to be bought and sold. Danton determined
to plead so long at the common law courts as might
assure him, with economy, a substantial addition to the
few hundred pounds that formed his whole capital, and
then to seek a loan that might eke out these savings
and place him at the Chancery bar.</p>

<p>Young, eloquent, eminently capable of seeing a real
issue, he was well fitted for the lower practice, and he
succeeded. Within two years he had a sum to offer as
part payment, which was at once a proof of his business
habits and of his talents. His family, therefore, especially
those members of it who had urged him to go to the
bar, were willing to advance the necessary sums in addition
to his own savings and his little patrimony. The
purchase-money was delivered, and a bond to the amount
of £3000 (a sum which he could not then have furnished)
was signed by his aunts and uncles at Troyes. It was
in March 1787<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> that this step was taken, and this date
was in some sense his entry into public life, for it brought
him into direct contact with the wealthy—that is, with
the ruling class.</p>

<p>We have on this date a vivid anecdote surviving.
A Latin oration had to be delivered off-hand to the
assembled college on the reception of a candidate to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_50"></a>[50]</span>
the order. The subject set for Danton when he entered
the hall was “The Moral and Political Situation of the
Country in their relations with the Administration of
Justice.” A fine theme for 1787! Such a quaint scene
the old regime delighted in, and its older members delighted
also in catching here and there a phrase of
quotation which they could understand. The genius
and the memory of their candidate seem on this occasion
to have furnished something new, to have given
them less platitude than was expected. He mentioned
reform; he spoke of the struggle in which the Parliament
was engaged against the ministers—a struggle of
which he wisely said, “They are fighting for the sacred
centres of civic liberty, but present no positive reform
by which that liberty may be brought into existence.”
“Sacred centres” was, of course, <i>aris et focis</i>. The
speech was necessarily in a large measure a series of
<i>clichés</i>, a stringing together of the well-worn Latin
mottoes. It even contained <i>salus populi suprema lex</i>, but
its argument was Danton’s own. There is to be marked
also this phrase, for it is the note of all his future work:
“Let the government feel the gravity of the situation
sufficiently to remedy it in the simple and in the natural
way downwards from its own authority.”</p>

<p>The young men understood and applauded; the old
men were assured that, if they had not quite followed
an unconventional harangue, it was due to the originality
of the speaker. Presumably their souls were softened
by <i>aris et focis</i>, and <i>salus populi suprema lex</i>.</p>

<p>For the next two years his forensic reputation is
continually rising. No longer the Common Law pleader,
with pathetic and oratorical appeals for a shepherd against
his lord, he had shown how large a part intellect had to
do with his power of commanding attention. On the
intricacies of his Chancery practice and the clearness
and ability of his analysis we have an excellent witness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_51"></a>[51]</span>
in one of the most learned of the modern Parisian bar,<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a>
and three of his opinions, on the Amelinau, Dubonis, and
De Montbarey cases, have come down to us, and have
received the favourable criticism of an opponent.</p>

<p>The last case (that of De Montbarey) shows us Danton
defending the claims of an old house and at work in the
rustiest of all the legal grooves. It had been on the
stocks since 1657, and Danton, in attempting to give
the quietus to this intolerable longevity, uses a phrase
which shows us the feeling that spared one grave
at least when the mob sacked St. Denis: “Jeanne
d’Albret<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> is a name dear to all Frenchmen, for it recalls
the memory of that other Jeanne d’Albret who was the
mother of Henri IV.”</p>

<p>There came to be his clients, among others De
Barentin, the minister of justice, and De Brienne,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> comptroller-general;
it is on his intimacy with the former
that his first recorded opinions on public affairs turn.
They will be dealt with in the next chapter.</p>

<p>It is, of course, difficult to give an exact proof of a
man’s private income at any moment, but we are certain
that Danton’s cannot have fallen far short at this date
of a thousand pounds a year. His immediate success
at the bar, the monopoly and privilege of the body to
which he now belonged (the work certain to come to
the most inept was worth a lump sum of 60,000 francs,
to which talent would add indefinitely), his eloquence
and proved ability, the name of his clients, their importance
and their wealth—everything leads to this as
a certain conclusion. Immense fortunes were not then
made in the profession; his position was not an obscure
one.</p>

<p>He married, on attaining this status, the daughter of
a man who kept one of the students’ restaurants, Charpentier<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_52"></a>[52]</span>
by name. It was a café (Café des Écoles) very
much frequented by the University and the younger men
at the bar, and still one of the few remaining cafés of the
last century. Danton himself was a regular customer,
and there is an interesting picture, drawn by a friend, of
the avocats in their special costumes at this place. It
occupied the site of what is now the south-western corner
of the Place de l’École,<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> nor has any change been made
in it save the raising of the road level. Looking on the
river, and just over the river from the Palais, it was the
natural rendezvous for the young barristers in the mid-day
adjournment and after the court rose.</p>

<p>Charpentier, the “limonadier” of Mdme. Roland,
was a man worth from five to six thousand pounds,
part only invested in his business;<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a> he had, moreover,
a little post under the Taxes, requiring a slight amount
of work and bringing in only a hundred pounds a year.
When he married his daughter to Danton, she was given
20,000 francs.<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">[28]</a></p>

<p>As will be seen later, it is of the first moment in
proving Danton’s position to know accurately the capital
amount of which he disposed when the Revolution broke
out; for in the case of generous men in a democracy,
the accusation of venality is the most common and the
hardest to rebut.</p>

<p>Passionately fond of his wife, and successful in his
profession, on the threshold of a great career, I would
apply to him a phrase which one of his worst enemies
has given us to describe a far lesser man, “Actif et sain,
robuste et glorieux, il aima sa femme et la parure.”</p>

<p>We leave him, then, at the summit of a laborious and
perhaps of an arduous youth. He is twenty-eight years
old, in the best of his vigour and of his intelligence—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_53"></a>[53]</span>
age at which Jefferson ten years before had drafted
his immortal paragraph; the age at which Napoleon, with
his moving island of men, was ten years later to break
five armies of the Austrians from Lodi to Campo Formio.</p>

<p>What picture shall we make of him to carry with
us in the scenes in which he is to be the principal actor?</p>

<p>He was tall and stout, with the forward bearing of
the orator, full of gesture and of animation. He carried
a round French head upon the thick neck of energy.
His face was generous, ugly, and determined. With wide
eyes and calm brows, he yet had the quick glance which
betrays the habit of appealing to an audience. His
upper lip was injured, and so was his nose,<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> and he had
further been disfigured by the small-pox, with which
disease that forerunner of his, Mirabeau, had also been
disfigured. His lip had been torn by a bull when he was
a child, and his nose crushed in a second adventure,
they say, with the same animal. In this the Romans
would perhaps have seen a portent; but he, the idol of
our Positivists, found only a chance to repeat Mirabeau’s
expression that his “boar’s head frightened men.”</p>

<p>In his dress he had something of the negligence
which goes with extreme vivacity and with a constant
interest in things outside oneself; but it was invariably
that of his rank. Indeed, to the minor conventions
Danton always bowed, because he was a man, and because
he was eminently sane. More than did the run of men
at that time, he understood that you cut down no tree
by lopping at the leaves, nor break up a society by throwing
away a wig.<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> The decent self-respect which goes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_54"></a>[54]</span>
with conscious power was never absent from his costume,
though it often left his language in moments of crisis, or
even of irritation.</p>

<p>I will not insist too much upon his great character
of energy, because it has been so over-emphasised as to
give a false impression of him. He was admirably sustained
in his action, and his political arguments were as
direct as his physical efforts were continuous, but the banal
picture of fury which is given you by so many writers is
false. For fury is empty, whereas Danton was full, and
his energy was at first the force at work upon a great
mass of mind, and later its momentum.</p>

<p>Save when he had the direct purpose of convincing
a crowd, his speech had no violence, and even no metaphor;
in the courts he was a close reasoner, and one who put
his points with ability and with eloquence rather than
with thunder. But in whatever he undertook, vigour
appeared as the taste of salt in a dish. He could not
quite hide this vigour: his convictions, his determination,
his vision all concentrate upon whatsoever thing he has
in hand.</p>

<p>He possessed a singularly wide view of the Europe
in which France stood. In this he was like Mirabeau,
and peculiarly unlike the men with whom revolutionary
government threw him into contact. He read and spoke
English, he was acquainted with Italian. He knew that
the kings were dilettanti, that the theory of the aristocracies
was liberal. He had no little sympathy with the
philosophy which a leisurely oligarchy had framed in
England; it is one of the tragedies of the Revolution
that he desired to the last an alliance, or at least peace,
with this country. Where Robespierre was a maniac in
foreign policy, Danton was more than a sane—he was a
just, and even a diplomatic man.</p>

<p>He was fond of wide reading, and his reading was of
the philosophers; it ranged from Rabelais to the physiocrats<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_55"></a>[55]</span>
in his own tongue, from Adam Smith to the “Essay
on Civil Government” in that of strangers; and of the
Encyclopædia he possessed all the numbers steadily accumulated.
When we consider the time, his fortune, and
the obvious personal interest in so small and individual a
collection, few shelves will be found more interesting
than those which Danton delighted to fill.<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a></p>

<p>In his politics he desired above all actual, practical,
and apparent reforms; changes for the better expressed
in material results. He differed from many of his
countrymen at that time, and from most of his political
countrymen now, in thus adopting the tangible. It was
a part of something in his character which was nearly
allied to the stock of the race, something which made
him save and invest in land as does the French peasant,<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a>
and love, as the French peasant loves, good government,
order, security, and well-being.</p>

<p>There is to be discovered in all the fragments which
remain to us of his conversations before the bursting of
the storm, and still more clearly in his demand for a
<i>centre</i> when the invasion and the rebellion threatened the
Republic, a certain conviction that the revolutionary
thing rather than the revolutionary idea should be produced:
not an inspiring creed, but a goal to be reached,
sustained him. Like all active minds, his mission was
rather to realise than to plan, and his energies were
determined upon seeing the result of theories which he
unconsciously admitted, but which he was too impatient
to analyse.</p>

<p>His voice was loud even when his expressions were
subdued. He talked no man down, but he made many
opponents sound weak and piping after his utterance.
It was of the kind that fills great halls, and whose deep
note suggests hard phrases. There was with all this a
carelessness as to what his words might be made to mean<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_56"></a>[56]</span>
when partially repeated by others, and such carelessness
has caused historians still more careless to lend a false
aspect of Bohemianism to his character. A Bohemian
he was not; he was a successful and an orderly man; but
energy he had, and if there are writers who cannot conceive
of energy without chaos, it is probably because in
the studious leisure of vast endowments they have never
felt the former in themselves, nor have been compelled
to control the latter in their surroundings.</p>

<p>As to his private life, affection dominated him. Upon
the faith of some who did not know him he acquired the
character of a debauchee. For the support of this view
there is not a tittle of direct evidence. He certainly loved
those pleasures of the senses which Robespierre refused,
and which Roland was unable to enjoy; but that his
good dinners were orgies or of any illegitimate loves
(once he had married the woman to whom he was so
devotedly attached) there is no shadow of proof. His
friends also he loved, and above all, from the bottom
of his soul, he loved France. His faults—and they were
many—his vices (and a severe critic would have discovered
these also) flowed from two sources: first, he
was too little of an idealist, too much absorbed in the
immediate thing; secondly, he suffered from all the evil
effects that abundant energy may produce—the habit of
oaths, the rhetoric of sudden diatribes, violent and overstrained
action, with its subsequent demand for repose.</p>

<p>Weighted with these conditions he enters the arena,
supported by not quite thirty fruitful years, by a happy
marriage, by an intense conviction, and by the talents
of a man who has not yet tasted defeat. I repeat the
sentence applied to another: “Active and sane, robust
and ready for glory, the things he loved were his wife
and the circumstance of power.”</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III<br />
<span class="smaller">DANTON AT THE CORDELIERS</span></h2>

</div>

<p>A man who is destined to represent at any moment the
chief energies of a nation, especially a man who will not
only represent but lead, must, by his nature, follow the
national methods on his road to power.</p>

<p>His career must be nearly parallel (so to speak) with
the direction of the national energies, and must merge
with their main current at an imperceptible angle. It is
the chief error of those who deliberately plan success that
they will not leave themselves amenable to such influences,
and it is the most frequent cause of their failure. Thus
such men as arrive at great heights of power are most
often observed to succeed by a kind of fatality, which is
nothing more than the course of natures vigorous and
original, but, at the same time, yielding unconsciously to
an environment with which they sympathise, or to which
they were born.</p>

<p>It is not difficult to determine the accidents of action,
temperament, and locality which predispose to success in
one’s own society. It is less easy to appreciate what corresponds
to them under foreign conditions.</p>

<p>It was seen in the first chapter that Paris sums up in
herself those conditions in the case of the French nation;
and it was seen also (a point of peculiar importance) that
Paris at the close of the eighteenth century was ill at ease—out
of herself, demanding her place and yet anxious as
to the means by which it might be attained.</p>

<p>It might be imagined that this was a kind of usurpation.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_58"></a>[58]</span>
Such a belief is entertained by most foreigners, and
certainly it has not been lacking among the more idealist
of the French Republicans. Nevertheless, such a view is
erroneous, and the Girondists, for all their virtues, went
(as we shall discover) against the nature of things when
they would have made of Paris but one of the cities, or
rather but “an aliquot voting part” of the nation. The
demand of Paris was essentially reasonable, and had to be
satisfied. Why? Because without her leadership not this
thing or that thing would have been done, but nothing
would have been done. The crowds who waited round
the coaching inns in the country towns for news of the
city in the great early days of ’89, by their very attitude
asked and expected Paris to move.</p>

<p>Paris, then, is Danton’s gate. It is up the flood of
the Parisian tide that he floats. That tide rises much
higher than even he had thought possible, and it throws
him at last on the high inaccessible place of the 10th of
August. Once there, from a pinnacle he sees all France.
Just as Cromwell was the Puritan soldier till he reached
power, and then became, or desired to become, the representative
of England, so Danton is the Parisian Frondeur
till from a place of responsibility and direction he aims
partly at the realisation of French ideas, but mainly at the
integrity and salvation of France itself.</p>

<p>Here he is, then, in the two years of active discussion
that precede the elections, by an accident of ambition,
Parisian; one of a group of young provincial lawyers,
but the most successful of them all. Some months after
his marriage, in the course of 1788<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> (we are not certain<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_59"></a>[59]</span>
of the exact date), he moved into the house in which he
lived to his death, six angry years. It was the corner
house of the Cour du Commerce and the Rue des Cordeliers.<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a>
The house was better than that which he had
inhabited in the Rue des Mauvaises Paroles, when he
bought his practice; on the other hand, it was in a somewhat
less expensive neighbourhood. We may justly infer,
however, from the greater size of his new apartments,
and from the fact that he kept his office still in the old
house in the Rue de la Tixanderie, just behind the Hotel
de Ville, that he had prospered in his profession, and the
inference is sustained by our knowledge of the importance
of his cases and his clients. As to the exact
situation which he chose, it was doubtless determined
by its proximity to the apartments of his friends. Here
lived Desmoulins, his chief friend, a year younger than
himself, coming (after his marriage in 1790) to live in the
same house; for then, as now, in Paris it was not the habit
to take a whole house but a flat, and Danton was on the
first, Desmoulins on the second floor. Just across the
river, over the Pont Neuf, was the café on the Quai de
l’École which his father-in-law had kept, and above all, he
was here in the midst of the youth of the schools. It
was the slope of the famous hill of the University. Close
by he would find the Café Procope, of which Desmoulins
had written with such enthusiasm, which had once been
illuminated with the little smile of Voltaire, which had
heard the assertion of Diderot, and which in 1788 was
noisy every night with discussion and speech and applause.
All that atmosphere of debate which comes unconsciously
to young men learning rose on the sides of the Mont
Parnasse and centred in the room; and here in the
winter of the year, in a society so entirely of his own
rank that the high bourgeoisie and the noblesse knew<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_60"></a>[60]</span>
nothing of its power, his great voice and generous face
filled the circle with their energy. But there was yet
no dream of revolution, still less of violence. France
was waiting for great things, but they were to come of
themselves, or on the wave of universal enthusiasm. The
fire, however, was lit, and the group which afterwards
passed from the Montagne to the scaffold of Germinal
was already formed.</p>

<p>To all this, however, which was but the relaxation of
an abundant spirit, must be added days of continual and
serious work on the other side of the river. If his nights
were in the Latin Quarter, his days were in the office of
the Rue de la Tixanderie. A minister of the crown<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> does
not intrust his family affairs to such a wastrel as the
chance memoirs of opponents would make of Danton at
this period, nor a lawyer who is never in his chambers,
but gadding about politicising, get the conduct of one of
the most important Chancery cases of his day.</p>

<p>There is one matter in these pre-revolutionary months
which is of no very great importance, but which is well
worth noticing, though the confusion apparent in our one
account of it has lessened its value. There can be no
doubt that Barentin, apart from his business relations,
was personally intimate with Danton; and when that
careful and moderate man had succeeded Lamoignon in
September 1788, there was some kind of informal offer
made to Danton of what we should call an official secretaryship
to the minister<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a>—or rather we have no name
for it, for the ministry in France was not associated with
legislation, but only with executive power, and therefore
positions in its gifts had not the political importance they
have with us.</p>

<p>As to the precise date of the offer, how far it was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61"></a>[61]</span>
pressed, or how seriously it was made, we can have no
exact knowledge. But it seems to me unwise to reject so
characteristic an anecdote, and one which fits in so well
with Danton’s known position, merely on the somewhat
strained theory that documentary evidence alone should
be admitted in history, and documentary evidence sifted
by the rules of a rigid cross-examination.<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a></p>

<p>At any rate, Danton refused it. And not only did he
refuse it, but there is no trace of an attempt to use his
friend’s influence or to make a political success at a time
when nearly every man’s head was turned by the chances
of a great social change. He felt no need of politics, and
it was not till much later, after quite twelve months of
action and speech, that his oratory found foothold, and he
felt the imperious appetites of a new power. Success in
his profession was without question the one ambition
which occupied him in the close of 1788, it was an
ambition closely bound up with that business sense which
was a strong element in the sane and practical mind of
the Champenois lawyer.</p>

<p>It was upon him and his group of friends, in a Paris
that every day grew keener in its discussion and attention,
that the long-expected decree of the 27th of December
fell. There were to be elections. Paris, all
pamphleteered to death, but inclining as a whole to the
moderate criticism of the more practical men, was at last
called upon to act.</p>

<p>Many conditions must be made clear before we can
understand the effect of these elections upon the history
of the next three years. In the first place, France was
suffering from a great material evil: she was going bankrupt,
her agriculture was hopelessly depressed, her industries<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_62"></a>[62]</span>
ruined, and thousands and thousands of men out of
work were wandering about the streets of the cities. In
the second place, the class which was going to vote for
the Commons was the tax-paying class. And in the
third place, the voting was by two degrees. I name
these three conditions as qualifying a broad and often
erroneous impression. I do not mean that the ideals
were not abroad; all the world knows how bright the
eyes of the young men were getting, and we are all
familiar with Desmoulins, eager, passionate, stuttering
but voluble, and passing from group to group as they
discussed or dreamed. But it is too common to read the
spirit of ’93 into those elections of ’89, and the error is
a grievous one. As well might you interpret the spirit
of an eloquent man who is about to defend a just and
practical cause by hearing what he said later in the day,
should his opponents have taken to fists and fought him
heavily for several hours.</p>

<p>The immediate need was fiscal; the class called upon
to meet it were the middle class; the men they were
about to elect were of professional rank.</p>

<p>The electoral units and all corporations were asked to
state their grievances before the gathering of the Parliament,
and it is in these “cahiers” that the spirit of the
time is best discovered. The abstractions, the phrases,
the great general conceptions are found (as we might
have expected, though it comes as a new thing) mainly in
the complaints of the clergy and nobility; the peasant, the
bourgeois, and the artisan have a more material grievance.</p>

<p>Thus the nobility of Caen in their cahier talk of the
“National Contract,” and the clergy of Forez (after some
remarks on the care and cleansing of ponds) end up with
an admirable little essay on individual liberty, its limits
and proper extension.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> The nobility of Nantes and of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63"></a>[63]</span>
Meulan talk roundly of the “rights of man,”<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> and generally
this order calls for a Constitution—of which word
they had in a very short time supped and dined. With
lesser men the demands are rather for sublunary things,
but the complaints that made Beugnot laugh give a good
picture. “To have one’s dogs killed if necessary but not
hamstrung, to be allowed to keep a cat, to be allowed
to light a fire without paying dues, to sell one’s wine
when one liked;” and from the bourgeoisie, regular
trial, abolition of lettres de cachet, the old European
policy that the growth of rich corporations should be
checked and much of their property confiscated, the
equalisation of taxation—such are the points upon which
(a mere redress) the great bulk of Frenchmen were
determined. One might sum up and say, “They demanded
the freedom and common justice obtainable in
the modern State.” But the privileged orders, for all
their phrases, resisted when the time for reform was
come, and their friction lit the flame of the ideal,
disastrously for themselves and happily for the world.</p>

<p>As for the cahier sent from the electoral district of
Paris in which Danton lived, it was destroyed by the
Commune when they burnt the Hotel de Ville in 1871.
We know, however,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> that it demanded “the destruction
of the Bastille,” a symbolic act ever present to the minds
of Parisians, and, for the matter of that, by several cahiers
of the provincial noblesse and clergy. There is no
direct documentary evidence that Danton helped to draw
up this cahier, but I cannot believe that a man of such
influence in so small a space and among (comparatively)
so few voters<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">[41]</a> had nothing to do with the framing of
this document, especially when we consider the cry he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64"></a>[64]</span>
gave as a boy, swimming in the river just beneath the
walls of the prison.<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">[42]</a> There is, however, nothing to prove
it, and he certainly took no memorable part in an action
where all was tranquil and even tedious.</p>

<p>The mention, however, of the districts of Paris, and
especially of that which could claim Danton, makes very
necessary a view of that focus of revolutionary energy. It
was called the district of the Cordeliers. It was small, one
of the smallest of the sixty into which Paris was divided,
yet it contained the very strongest of the brains and
eloquence of its time, very few nobles, and, for the matter
of that, very few of the artisans and hardly any of the proletariat.
Later, when Danton threatened the reactionaries
with the populace, it was not to the district of the Cordeliers,
but to the Faubourg St. Marceau that he appealed;
for the workmen were rare in its ancient, narrow streets,
with their tall houses and little dark courts framing each
some relic of the Middle Ages. Here were found many of
the clergy, but above all a swarm of the young lawyers
and students, the class that think high and hard and
breed thoughts in others, a kind of little united clan
of what was strongest in the youth of the University and
the professions; and the whole homogeneous group centred
round Danton.</p>

<p>If you stood in the Cour du Commerce in Danton’s
time, and looked north to where his house made the
corner of the narrow entry, you would have seen a main
street only a trifle broader than the court, and running
at right angles. Standing in the mouth of the narrow
passage, you would have seen on the other side of the
main street, and a hundred yards up it, a little fifteenth-century
turret, capped with a pointed slate roof and
jutting outward on round supports.<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> This was the extreme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_65"></a>[65]</span>
angle of an old convent called the Cordeliers.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">[44]</a>
Here the Franciscans had settled in St. Louis’s time, five
hundred years before, but the walls you would have seen
were not of the thirteenth, but rather of the early fourteenth
century, while the church which flanked the
street was of the sixteenth, and additions had been made
of all periods. As you came out of the Cour du Commerce
and went up the street, you would have the convent
running all along the opposite side, from the little turret
on the corner to the church of St. Come in the Rue de la
Harpe, save where it was interrupted by private houses,
and where it was broken in one place by a little lane
leading to the hall of the University College, which the
convent supported. Like so many great foundations, this
rich place was in full decay, and the vaulted hall, with
its dim light and resonant echoes, was given over to the
meeting of the district, and later to the thunder of the
voice that threw back the armies of Europe. Alone of
all the mediæval buildings of the Cordeliers this hall
remains to-day as the Musée Dupuytren.</p>

<p>There is yet one further point to be mentioned before
we can make a complete picture of Danton’s position
before these elections of 1789. There can be no doubt
that the Masonic lodges had proved a powerful instrument
in the preparation of opinion, and though our information
on their formation in Paris is scanty, we can safely affirm
that Danton belonged to the lodge of the “Nine Sisters,”
which included such members as Sieyès or Bailly on the
one hand and Collot D’Herbois on the other.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> It would
be foolish to over-estimate the influence of these societies.
The subsequent history of their members proves quite
clearly that the bond between them was slight (who can,
for instance, reproach Desmoulins with a secret support of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_66"></a>[66]</span>
Bailly?), and (what is much more important) the very
character of their composition disproves effectually any
secret or prearranged action. The foolish Bailly, the
learned Sieyès, the admirable, unpractical, high-minded
Condorcet, the weak Garat, Collot D’Herbois the potential
Red, all members of one lodge! They can have been
little more than associations whose character of mutual
help and whose opportunities of club-life (that comfort so
lacking in Paris) attracted men. They were authorised,
and were one of the very few kinds of refuge from a
society where political discussion had decayed and where
combined action was almost unknown.</p>

<p>This is all the importance, I think, which should be
attached to them. Where men are free, and where the
suffrage is open and common, secret societies may very
justly be dreaded; their action will be at all times
separate from that of society in general, and may be in
a hidden antagonism to the will of the nation. But in
a society where reunion, discussion, and all that is the
blood of civic political life has been exhausted, then, like
a special drug which cures, they have an excellent use.
They may, in such societies, just keep alive the habit
of political conversation and expectancy, and they may
develop in some at least that organising spirit without
which a political movement degenerates into anarchy.</p>

<p>This, then (to recapitulate), is Danton’s position just
before the Parisian elections. He is in the midst of
what are to be his group of young Revolutionary friends
on the outskirts of the Latin quarter; his daily occupation
is the conducting in his office on the north bank
and at the Palace in the Cité of those important pleas in
the highest court, which bring him into contact with the
ministers, with the great corporations, and especially with
the various organs of government of the old regime—for
it was in cases for and against these that the Conseil du
Roi came into play. His income is sufficient for his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_67"></a>[67]</span>
needs and for a slow but methodical payment of the price
of his practice. It amounted (we may presume) to something
in the neighbourhood of 25,000 francs, possibly a
little less, but not much, for it was drawn from one of
the most important Chancery cases of his day, and his
clientele, to judge by the names which alone have reached
us, was wealthy and of influence. He was thoroughly
well read; he was not expecting nor planning a political
career, as were so many of his friends (for instance, Desmoulins),
but certain characters which he was rapidly
developing, or rather discovering, in himself were preparing
that career of necessity. He was learning in
discussion and laughter, first that he was an orator, and
secondly that his energy sufficed for a whole group of
men, and that he could avoid leadership only at the
expense of entire seclusion. In a time of innumerable
pamphlets, he never put pen to paper outside his profession;
and in days that were producing the ardent
similes of Camille, and that were just beginning to feel
the ravings of Marat, he wrote nothing but three grave,
learned, concise, and dull opinions, which were admirable
in argument, clear in exposition, and tolerable only to
elderly lawyers.</p>

<p>As for his politics, he was centred wholly on the
outward thing. He seems to have lacked almost entirely
the metaphysic. Here was France all ruined and every
day approaching more nearly to disaster; let her be
turned into a place where men should be happy, should
have enough to eat and drink, should be good citizens
to the extent of making the nation homogeneous and
strong. Reform should be practical: in part it would
require discussion, not too much of it. In part, however,
its lines were laid down for it. Economics taught certain
truths; let them be applied. He had read in Adam
Smith certain indubitable principles of this science; let
them be used. Science had in such and such matters<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_68"></a>[68]</span>
definite remedies to offer; let them be applied. Such
were his over-simple aims. He was of the Encyclopædists.
Had he no beliefs, then, in his politics? Undoubtedly
he had; no man could desire “the good”
without feeling it. But, like all minds of his type, he
refused to analyse. His dogmas were all the more
dogmas because he took them so entirely for granted
that he refused even to define them. At a time when
all men had their first principles ready-made in words,
his was rather that confused instinct which is, after all,
nearest to the truth. Patriotism, good-fellowship, freedom
for his activities, the satisfaction of the thirst for
knowledge—all these he desired in himself and for the
State. And that is why you will find his great body at
the head of mobs and daring criminal things when it is
a question of saving the nation, or later of breaking an
inquisitorial idea. It is this simplicity which makes him
daring, and this concentration on a few obvious points
which makes him judicious, unscrupulous, and successful
in the choice of means and of phrases.</p>

<p>On the 24th of January 1789, the Primaries were
convened. It was the opportunity for movement, in
Paris especially, since it was the first definite action after
so much discussion, attention, and fever. The district
of the Cordeliers met in the hall of which so much
mention has been made above. But there does not seem
to have been anything of importance transacted, unless we
call this important; I mean the beginnings of the habit
of reunion and of open discussion. For three months the
place seems to have had its doors open to the first comer
of the quarter. The cahier was drawn up here, and the
rough foundations of what was to be the famous permanent
survival of the “République des Cordeliers” were
laid. But of Danton’s part in all this we have, as I
have said above, no trace. We can only conjecture and
infer.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69"></a>[69]</span></p>

<p>It was on April 21 that the elections were finally
held. The voters all met together in the central halls of
their districts (churches for the most part) and elected
the electors, who in their turn were to nominate the
deputies for Paris. Of Danton’s rôle in this important
action, again we know nothing. M. Bougeart<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> has taken
it for granted that he was at least “president of the
district,” chairman (as we should say) of the electoral
meeting; but he is either in error, or else he is relying
on some verbal evidence which he has not given us.
We have no document to prove it, and we know that
three months later Timbergue and Achimbault, two
barristers of the district, were successively presidents, not
Danton.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">[47]</a> What we do know of importance is that the
Cordeliers were among those districts which did not
disperse after the elections, but maintained themselves
as a permanent club. This action by the districts was
of the very first importance in the history of the Revolution.
It created the municipal movement in July, it
made Paris an organisation, gave the town a method and
a voice, and more than any other accident it placed the
ladder for Danton’s feet.</p>

<p>The elections of Paris once completed, the gates of
the Revolution are passed, and the States-General, whose
Commons formulated its first principles, are definitely
formed; for Paris completed its voting much later than
the provinces. The Parliament meets at Versailles, and
that town presents for the next six months the centre
of official interest. But since Paris is going to be, by its
destiny, the heart of the reform, and since Danton is the
tribune of Paris, we must, for the purposes of this
biography, mention the assembly only in its relation to
what passed in the capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_70"></a>[70]</span></p>

<p>The tone of Paris during the first two months of the
Parliament was, as has been expressed earlier in this
chapter, essentially one of ill-ease and watching. But
this anxiety of the town took long to find a formula and
to recognise its own nature. What Paris needed was
the leadership; but to hear the confused murmur of the
thousand voices, you would have thought that all her
demands were for a number of more or less conflicting
ideals. And yet there was no appearance of Party. One
may say, by a just paradox, that her very cliques made
for solidarity. The higher bourgeoisie could afford at
first to ignore the group of the Latin Quarter, thinking
the young lawyers and students to be merely foolish
demagogues, not even dangerous. The ears of these last
were closed to the confused demands of the populace, and
the orators could honestly believe that ideas rather than
hunger were to be the goad of change. By great good
fortune their position was never wholly abandoned, and
the Revolution from first to last mastered Materialism
and its attendant Anarchy. Finally, the poor—the out-of-work,
the starving labourers of the economic crisis—standing
apart from both these leading classes, could
convince themselves that the great phrases meant bread,
and that a constitution was allied in some vague way to a
lowering of prices. They were right in that instinct, but,
with the picturesque inexactitude of mobs, they fearfully
under-estimated the length of the connecting links.</p>

<p>The place where the average of these different views
could best be found was the Palais Royal. Here a great
popular forum gathered in the gardens which the Duke
of Orleans had thrown open to the people. It was not a
bad thing that the debts of this debauchee and adventurer
had led him to let out the ground-floor of the wide quadrangle,
for the cafés and shops that surrounded it made
it a more permanent resort than the squares or gardens
could have been, and there could be a perpetual mob-parliament<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_71"></a>[71]</span>
held from day to day. Its orators were the
Dantonist group; its instigators, I fear, the unprincipled
men who surrounded D’Orleans, its committee-room and
centre (as it were) the Café Foy. Still, by the action of
the main virtue of revolutions, the general sense of the
meeting was stronger than any demagogue; for in such
times society is not only turbulent but fluid, and while it
will support a leader who can swim, no mortal force can
give it any direction other than that which it desires.</p>

<p>In this great daily crowd Danton was a prominent
but not a principal figure; undoubtedly (though we cannot
prove it by any record) he had begun to speak in his
district, and we may presume that his voice had been
heard in the Palais Royal before July; for just after the
fall of the Bastille his name is mentioned familiarly. But
even had he desired to identify himself with the place,
which is doubtful, his profession would not have permitted
it. He was not briefless, unmarried, and free,
like Desmoulins, but a man of three years’ standing in
the highest branch of his profession; doubtless, however,
he was present daily when the crowd was thickest—I
mean on the holidays and during the summer evenings.</p>

<p>All this pamphleteering, discussion, violence, salonising,
oratory, and anxious criticism, even the mob violence
which hunger and bad laws had inflamed, found a head
in the three famous days that followed July 12, 1789.
All the world knows the story, and even were it unfamiliar
it would be impossible to treat of it at any length in this
book, for Danton’s name hardly touches it, and our only
interest here, in connection with his life, is to discover if
he took part in the street fighting; for the event itself,
one of the most decisive in history, a few words must
suffice.</p>

<p>Paris, and especially the Palais Royal, had been
watching the struggle at Versailles with gathering anger.
There, twelve miles off, every purpose for which the Parliament<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_72"></a>[72]</span>
had met, and every good thing which the elections
had seemed to ensure, lay in jeopardy. Step after step
the Commons had in fact, though not in their phrases,
been beaten, and the promises of six months before seemed
in danger, not through any known or calculable enemy,
but from the sudden appearance of an opposition which
the nation, and especially Paris, had ignored. The King
had retreated from his position of the last December, and
the privileged orders were sympathising with a growing
reaction. How far all this was due to the unconstitutional
and unprecedented action of the Commons in insisting
on a General Assembly cannot be discussed here.
Suffice it to say that, in the opinion of the nation, the
new departure of the Commons was in thorough accordance
with the spirit, if not with the letter, of the recent
decrees; the King was held to have broken his word, and
the privileged orders to have abandoned their declarations
in the face of facts. The symbol, though a poor one, of
the constitutional position was the personality of Necker.
Conceited, foreign, and common-place, the father of an
authoress whom neither Napoleon nor posterity could
tolerate, Genevese and bourgeois to the backbone, this
mass of impotence yet stood, by one of the ironies of
history, in the place of an idol. He, the banker, was
the imagined champion for the moment of that other
man from Geneva, who had died of persecution ten years
before, the tender-eyed, wandering, unfortunate Rousseau,
between whom and him was the distance between a
financier and an apostle.</p>

<p>While the king was changing his advisers, and even
while the foreign troops—fatal error—were being massed
in wretched insufficiency on the Champ de Mars (not three
miles from the Palais Royal) Necker still stood like a
wooden idol, a kind of fetish safeguard against force. He
just prevented the growing belief in the dissolution from
becoming a certitude, and on account of his attitude Paris<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_73"></a>[73]</span>
waited. These things being so, the king began his great
programme of working out the good of his people alone.
Relying on the three thousand foreigners, a regiment of
home troops, and practically no guns wherewith to hold
in check a tortuous city of close on a million souls, the
king on Saturday, July 11, dismissed Necker.</p>

<p>Desmoulins first brought the news, running. It was
the morrow, Sunday, and the Palais Royal was crowded.
He forgot his stammer and hesitancy, and shouted to the
great holiday crowd in the gardens to strip the trees for
emblems, led them as they marched to the Place Louis
Quinze, saw the French troops defend their fellow-citizens
against the mounted mercenaries, and heard during a
night of terror and of civil war the first shots of
Revolution.</p>

<p>All the next day, Monday, July 13, 1789, Paris
organised and prepared. Thanks to the permanence of
the assemblies in certain districts, a rough machinery was
ready, and on the 14th, a Tuesday, two great mobs
determined upon arms. The time is not untainted, for
St. Huruge was there promising and leading, but if
D’Orleans was trying to make the most of the adventure,
he no more created the uprising than a miller makes the
tide. One stream of men seized the arsenal at the
Invalides on the west side of the town, the other going
east in a smaller band demanded arms of the governor
of the Bastille, a place impossible to take by assault.
The demand was refused.</p>

<p>A body of men, however, were permitted to enter the
courtyard, for which purpose the drawbridge had been
lowered: once in that trap, De Launay fired upon them
and shot them down. There is no evidence, nor ever
will be, as to the motives of that extraordinary act; but
to the general people who were gathering and gathering
all about in the narrow streets, it was an act of deliberate
treason, part of that spirit with which our own time is<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74"></a>[74]</span>
not unfamiliar, and which has ruined a hundred reforms,—I
mean the sentiment that there is no honour to be kept
between government and insurrection. The misfortune or
crime of De Launay struck a clear note in the crowd; if
after that they failed, the blow that was being struck for
the Parliament would fail also. Thus it was that, under
a dull grey sky, the whole of Paris, as it were, ran up
together to the siege of the fortress. Curés were there
gathering up their soutanes and joining the multitude,
notably the man who had once been Danton’s parish
priest, the vicar of St. Germains, with his flock at his
heels, like the good Curé of Bazeilles in later times, or
the humorous Bishop of Beauvais six centuries before.
Lawyers, students, shopkeepers, merchants, the big
brewer of the quarter, the pedants, the clerks in the
offices, soldiers and their officers, the young nobles even—there
was nothing in Paris that did not catch the fever.
The castle fell at last, because its garrison sympathised
with the mob (of itself it was impregnable); the old
governor made a futile attempt to blow up his stronghold
and his command; some few who still obeyed him
(probably the twenty Swiss) fired on the mob just after
the white flag had been hoisted on the Bazinière tower,
and a great tide of men mad with a double treason
swirled up the fortress. Second on the wall was a man
with whom this book will have to deal again—Hérault
de Séchelles, young, beautiful, and of great family, beloved
at the court and even pampered with special
privilege, the friend and companion of Danton, and
destined five years later to stand in the cart with him
when they all went up to the scaffold together on a
clear April evening in the best time of their youth.</p>

<p>The Cordeliers were in the attack, and presumably
Danton also, since all the world was there. But his
only allusion to the scene is a phrase of his circular to
the courts when he took the Ministry of Justice in 1792,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"></a>[75]</span>
and he mentions his district only without including his
own name. One anecdote, and only one, connects him
with the days of July. It seems that in the night of the
morrow, the early morning of the 16th, he was at the
head of a patrol in that sudden levy of which mention
will be made in this chapter. He thought it his duty to
pass into the court of the Bastille, probably in order to
gather some detached portion of his command; but he
was met by Soulès, whom the informal meeting at the
Hotel de Ville had named governor. Full of new-fangled
importance, Soulès pompously forbad him to enter, and
showed his commission. Danton did a characteristic
thing, part and parcel of that intense sectionalism upon
which he based all his action until Paris was at last in
possession of herself: for him power was from below, and
the armed district had a right of passage: he called the
informal commission a rag, arrested Soulès, and shut him
up in the guardroom at the Cordeliers; then, with a
rather larger force, he marched him back through the
streets and gave him into the custody of the Hotel de
Ville, whose authority for judgment he admitted. The
matter would be of no importance were it not for the
fact that, in the very natural and on the whole just
censure which the informal municipality passed on Danton’s
action, Lafayette showed an especial bitterness.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">[48]</a>
It was the first clash between two men one of whom was
to conquer and drive out the other; and it was a
typical quarrel, for Danton stood in the matter for the
independence of the electoral unit and for the power of
Paris over itself: Lafayette represented the principle of
a strong municipality based on moderate ideas and on a
limited suffrage; in other words, the compromise which
was planned for the very purpose of muzzling the
capital.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_76"></a>[76]</span></p>

<p>I have spoken of an armed force and a patrol: it is
in this connection that the meaning of the days of July—for
Danton and for the Revolution—must be considered.
They form above all a municipal reform. Those towns of
which I have spoken as being the bond of France harked
back suddenly to their primitive institutions, and were
organising communal government. Paris of course was
the leader. Even before the taking of the Bastille, the
districts had in some cases maintained their electoral
colleges as a permanent committee, and these electoral
colleges met at the Hotel de Ville, forming a rough
government for the two nights of the revolt, and finally
directing the whole movement. Such a body was of
necessity too large to work. But its plans were rapidly
formed. They named a committee, which was formed of
electors with one citizen (not an elector) added. They
invited and obtained the aid of the permanent officers of
what had once been the old dying and corrupt corporation,
and they thus had formed an irregular but sufficient
organ of government for the city. It was not confirmed
from above, nor had it, for days, any authority from the
King, but it reposed on a force which was admitted in
the theory of those times to be the source of power, for
it was composed of men elected by the new suffrage.
They had been elected for another purpose, but they were
the only popular representatives present at all in Paris.</p>

<p>Their weakness, however, lay in this quality of theirs.
Reposing merely upon power from the districts, they
could not act with central authority, nor had they an
armed force of their own. They could, indeed, prevent
the success of the rough anarchy which threatened the
Hotel de Ville itself in the early morning of July 14,
before the attack on the Bastille, but they could not
prevent the lynching of those against whom the popular
rage had arisen—De Launey, De Méray, De Persan. As
for force, they organised a huge levy of 1200 men from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77"></a>[77]</span>
each of the sixty districts, a force which, with certain
additions, rose to 78,000. It was in this suddenly armed
militia that Danton was elected a captain (for the moment),
and in connection with its duties of police on the nights
following the taking of the Bastille that his quarrel with
Soulès had occurred. They named Bailly their first mayor.
They gave the command of the new national guard to
Lafayette; on the 16th they ordered, with a pomp of
trumpets in the Place de Grève, the destruction of the
Bastille, in which their new governor was installed. But
through all this vigorous action there is one cardinal fact
to be remembered: the whole of their power was from
below, not only in theory but in fact. We may construct
a metaphor to express the future effect of this, and say
that, at the very origin of the Revolution, the body of
government in Paris was tainted by an organic weakness
which no structural changes could remove, and to whose
character all subsequent events for three years can be
traced. It was essentially <i>federal</i>; feeble at the centre,
continually asking leave, morally a servant and not a
master; lacking above all things the supreme force of
conviction, it acted without power because it did not
believe in itself.</p>

<p>The history, then, of its struggle with the extremists
is the history of a body attempting by compromise and
ruse to attain a position whose theory it openly denies,
whose moral right it will not affirm, and whose very
existence is made dependent upon those whom it would
coerce against their will. The municipality tried to be a
strong government while it openly approved of voluntaryism,
to be powerful in its acts and weak in its
structure. Ultimately the centre of compromise is captured
by ardent revolutionaries whom it has attempted
to check, and <i>then</i> we get a true despotism in Paris—the
terrible commune of the second period of the Republic
and of the Terror.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"></a>[78]</span></p>

<p>But if the character of the new municipal government
(a character which became specially prominent after
the legislation of the whole system later in the year) is
the special feature of the movement, its general motive
is of course more important. We have called it the
Reform; what occurred in the next few days was without
any question the origin of the active Revolution, and a
little examination of facts will show that the taking of
the Bastille was not merely a dramatic incident, still less
the exaggerated <i>bagarre</i> that certain modern special pleaders
would make it, but, on the contrary, the foundation of everything.
The contemporaries are proved to have been right
in their view of this matter, as of so many others.</p>

<p>Why was this? Because, first, in taking the Bastille,
after having sacked the Invalides, the people of Paris
(for it was not a particular mob, but a gathering of every
possible class) held all the cannon in the city, and
were thoroughly provided with small arms. They were
suddenly become the masters of that insufficient camp
in the Champ de Mars on which the King had relied.
In open country and without artillery these seventy
thousand civilians would, of course, have been so many
sheep, but in the town and with a number of old artillerymen
(officers and men) to work their guns, it was another
matter. On and after July 14, 1789, Paris had found
that possession of herself which we postulated as her first
great appetite in the Revolution.</p>

<p>Secondly, by this sudden stroke Paris forced the
Court to capitulate. At Versailles the King went bareheaded
to the Assembly, gave permission for the reunion
of the three orders, for a discussion of grievances before
supply, for the title of National Assembly, for the formation
of a constitution before the voting of fiscal measures—in
a word, for all that the Commons had demanded, and
for the fulfilment of all the promises from which he had
attempted to recede.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_79"></a>[79]</span></p>

<p>Thirdly, the victory, or rather the act of Paris, changed
and weakened the opposition. From openly gathering
troops, and boasting an approaching attack on the Parliament,
they are reduced to intrigue and to the difficult
business of arming in the dark. Many of the heads of
the reaction (notably the Comte d’Artois) leave France
in the “first emigration,” and the whole action of the
uncompromising party is made weaker, and clearly unnational.</p>

<p>Fourthly (and perhaps this is the most important
point), that municipal movement, of which mention has
been made above, took its rise directly from the 14th of
July. The towns hear of Necker’s dismissal and of the
Parisian rising by the same courier, and in a week or
ten days the story is repeated all over France. Rouen,
Lyons, Valence, Montpellier, Nîmes, Tours, Amiens (to
cite but a few of the more prominent examples), organise
a new town government. Sometimes the old hereditary
or appointed body is deposed, more often it is enlarged
by the addition of the electoral college of the city;
occasionally it takes upon itself the task of adding
to itself representatives of the three orders. Again,
the towns arm themselves as Paris did; and finally, by
what a contemporary called “spontaneous anarchy,” the
whole network of cities has received the pulse and vibration
of Paris; the National Guards are being drilled in
thousands; the rusty, confused, and broken machinery
of the <i>ancien régime</i> is replaced by a simple if rough
system of local government. Moreover, since all this has
been done by the people themselves, and without a command
or a centralised effort, since it is natural and not
artificial, it has entered into the body of the Revolution
and cannot be undone.</p>

<p>You see, then, that the days of July gave Paris the
first word, and made the spirit of sectionalism and local
autonomy based upon a highly democratic theory. All<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_80"></a>[80]</span>
these things are the conditions of Danton’s rise; they
make possible, and even necessary, the society of which
he is to be the guide. After the 14th of July the Cordeliers
meet daily; the bell was rung above the church
at nine in the morning, and an assembly of the district
was held.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> It was not yet in name the famous “club”;
but when we consider the action of the popular societies
in Paris, we must always remember that this, even before
it regularly assumed its final name and functions, was a
society organised for debate and action, and that it was
the first to be established.</p>

<p>From its origin, this famous meeting is sharply marked
in its spirit—the spirit that will later divide it not only
from the moderate clubs, such as the Feuillants, but from
the Jacobins themselves. In the first place, it is Parisian;
it attempts no provincial propaganda; it confines itself to
action in Paris, and even to its own immediate neighbourhood.
In the second place, it is purely popular. But (it
may be asked) were not the Jacobins in their later stage
a purely popular club? No, not in the same sense.
The Jacobins, as will be seen later in this book, were
an organised body; the public was admitted to their
galleries; but, even in the most feverish time of the
Revolution, they are distinguished by a close bond from
the general people. Their membership is almost exclusively
confined to the politicians, and their business is
inquisitorial. They preach certain political dogmas, and
make it their affair to canalise the Revolutionary current;
they desire to establish in France a Republican religion,
as it were, and we shall see later in Robespierre their
high priest and dictator.</p>

<p>The Cordeliers had nothing of all this. If the
Royalist writers begin calling them from the outset the
“République des Cordeliers,” it is because they show the
general spirit which Danton surely gave to, rather than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_81"></a>[81]</span>
received from, his district. Freedom of opinion, the value
of varied discussion, open doors, and even an intermingling
with the street—such were their methods. The men
who sat on the benches would vary from one hundred to
three,<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> according to the interest of the debate or the
value of the occasion. The number inscribed on the
registers of the society were simply the whole voting
strength of the district; under the limited suffrage of
the time it would fluctuate round the figure six hundred;
and hence we may observe that those who were so
strongly touched by the contemporary movement as to
add meeting and debating to their mere votes numbered
a good half of the electorate. Standing grouped, or
moving in and out of the far end of the hall, would be
the chance-comers, the disfranchised multitude of the
district—those even who had no residence in the quarter,
but whom anger, interest, or curiosity might attract. It
was composed of every kind of man—the pedantic but
accurate Sieyès; the fastidious radical and poet D’Eglantine;
the coarse, brutal, and atheistic Hébert; Desmoulins,
ardent and admirably polished, linked by his style to the
classics of his own country and of Rome; Legendre, the
master-butcher, no great politician, but an honest friend;
and, added to all these, the lawyers. There was a preponderance
of the young men, the students and barristers
in their thirtieth year; but take it all in all,
it was the most representative, the most general of the
meetings.</p>

<p>The society, then, from which Danton rises is marked
by these characters: it tends always to defend the presence
in politics of the whole people; it is unitarian,
designing above all things a common ground where
Frenchmen may found the new order in harmony; and
finally, it possesses nothing of the metaphysical spirit<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82"></a>[82]</span>
abroad at the time. It is all for action along the lines
of common sentiments—the defence of the new individual
liberty, the destruction as soon as may be of whatever
relics of the old machinery might be spared by the fear
or inertia of certain reformers.</p>

<p>I cannot leave what has already grown to an over-lengthy
description of their political attitude without
touching upon a quality of theirs, which was not indeed
a principle, but which was a method of action necessarily
flowing from the ideas they held. The Cordeliers are
essentially “Frondeurs.” They are rebellious and in
opposition so long as the Revolution remains incomplete.
They do things deliberately illegal, but which they justly
consider to be in the spirit of the reform and calculated
to aid its rapid development. Why was this? Because
the day after Paris had captured the position, in the very
moment when the city had forced reaction into subterranean
channels, her power was bridled. The King came
to Paris on the 17th of July and confirmed the revolutionary
appointments. Bailly is mayor, and Lafayette is
commissioned head of the National Guard. In those two
names you have the forces, or rather the resistances,
against which Danton and the Cordeliers made it their
business to fight. Both of them were amiable, both
weak, and both sincere; but they belonged, the one to
the high bourgeoisie, the other to the noblesse; they
were both full of an intense class-prejudice; both thought
rather of the restraints to be imposed than of the great
change in the midst of which they lived. The little
movements that Bailly might have mistaken for an
enthusiasm would arise at the sight of his telescope; the
undoubted excitability of Lafayette was aroused by the
public mention of his own name. Under these weaknesses
their external sign was pomposity, their political
action an attempt to confine the Revolution to the middle
class. Thus, later, the sixty districts are replaced by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83"></a>[83]</span>
forty-eight sections in order to jerrymander the Parisian
radicals; thus Bailly tries to oppose Parisian appeals to
the Parliament; and thus Lafayette not only attempts
to convert the National Guard into a political army, but
makes it impossible for the poor to join it.</p>

<p>Against all this the Cordeliers set their face. Such
a partial conception of the State was the enemy of that
ideal by which they lived and which has formed the
Republic in France and the Jeffersonian democracy in
America. Only four days after the King had worn his
tricolour cockade, smiling on the balcony of the Hotel
de Ville, they issue and print a resolution to use the
armed force of their district at its own discretion; they
do not (of course) claim to act further, but they determine
to be themselves the police which shall conduct
prisoners to the tribunals.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> At the close of 1789, and
especially in the succeeding year, we shall find them in
the affair of Marat, of Danton’s election, of the <i>Mandat
Imperatif</i>, and of the Châtelet continually acting in the
spirit of local autonomy, and refusing to admit any
central authority save that of the whole people—bowing
after every revolt to the Assembly, but refusing to admit
the bourgeois power.</p>

<p>The end of July was the destruction of the feudality
in France. When the towns had fallen with a shock into
the new conditions, the great dust of villages rose of itself
into a storm, and there passed over all the countrysides
that strange panic, “The Great Fear,” whose legend alone
of Revolutionary memories remains among the peasantry
to-day.</p>

<p>The woods were full of terrors; ploughmen started
out at night by bands to meet invisible armies; an unsubstantial
enemy threatened the thousands of little<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"></a>[84]</span>
lonely villages that lie undefended on the skirts of forests
or lost on the leagues and leagues of plains. In that
mysterious panic the Jacquerie arose; the cowed and the
oppressed, who had forgotten the generous anger which
makes men brave, rose under the lash of fear. They had
heard of the promises of reform, they had seen the
cahiers drawn up that they might become free men, and
yet the town close by had risen and armed because
something had gone wrong; the King, whom they loved,
was not allowed to help his people; some one was delaying
or destroying their hopes, and the brigands were coming
down the road. Not with committees, organisation, and
battalions, as the intelligence of the towns had just done,
but instinctively and with the anarchy of the torch they
destroyed the skeleton idol of the old regime. Like their
fathers of four hundred years before, they were out to
destroy the records of their servitude, and where the
records were defended the country-houses burned. But
this time no vengeance followed: the wild beast was dead.
When in the noisy night of the 4th of August the privileged
men scattered away their rights, then that last
largesse of the nobles, the “Orgy,” as Mirabeau called it,
was but a gift of things already taken. After Paris, after
the cities, the peasantry had suddenly stiffened the phrases
by an act; perhaps it was their formless and vague energy
that laid the heaviest of the foundation-stones, for we
are told that in twenty years an exile returning thought
that France had been re-peopled with a new kind of
men.</p>

<p>It is not wonderful that, with such a fire just
smouldering down, and with the spirit of renunciation
abroad as well, a regular stream of emigration should set
out. But it did not leave the opposition powerless
though it deprived it of chiefs. If we consider the Court,
the capital, and the Assembly in the months of August
and September, the next great step (and the first in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85"></a>[85]</span>
connection with which the name of Danton is directly
connected) becomes clear.</p>

<p>At Versailles all the first part of August is taken
up in voting the famous decree which consecrated the
debate of the 4th. The Parliament abolished feudal
dues, declaring all rights in service at an end, and
establishing a period for the national purchase and subsequent
abolition of the rest of the feudal dues. All
the second part of August and the whole of September
were occupied in drawing up the declaration of the
rights of man and in decreeing the fundamental articles
of the new Constitution. The National Assembly, then,
as a whole, is thoroughly the organ of France. It is not
yet so divided as to arouse definite party feeling in the
capital, nor to prevent on important occasions a practically
unanimous vote. But there is another factor. The
Court (especially the Queen) has a definite party formed;
it has its correspondence with the emigrés, and they with
the personalities, if not with the official organs of foreign
governments. It was without any question the object
of this very small and very powerful group to arrest the
Revolution, and if possible to wipe out the last six
months. Between and above these stands the King.
Louis (we are too apt to forget it in our knowledge of
what follows) still possessed far more power even than the
National Assembly; not only by the political decrees of
the time, but by that immeasurable force of custom, by
the affection which he personally had inspired in the
great bulk of men, he was a powerful king. What was
his attitude? He was patriotic; he greatly sympathised
with the ideas at the root of the reform; he was sensible,
and saw the practical value of casting away what is
broken and worn out. On the other hand, he was not
brave (especially in the face of the unknown); new
developments irritated him; he was (by the inevitable
result of his training) determined to preserve in his own<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_86"></a>[86]</span>
hands the bulk of power, and sometimes he was panic-stricken
at a phrase or a debate which seemed to put it
in jeopardy. Finally—a matter of the utmost importance
with a character of such well-balanced mediocrity—the
people with whom he hunted, dined, and conversed
were almost all of them members of a powerful, bitter,
and skilful faction, headed by the most determined and
able of all—his wife, for whom he had latterly developed
a marked tenderness and even respect.</p>

<p>This ring of courtiers, who were Louis’s evil fates, had
a certain quality that gave them great power in spite of
their small numbers. It must be remembered that they
were of the high cosmopolitan type, those who, a generation
earlier, delighted in the wit of Voltaire, who, a
generation later, smiled at merely hearing the name
of Talleyrand. Perhaps there was never a body better
fitted to influence an isolated man by phrases, continual
conversation, and intrigue.</p>

<p>What is the effect? That the King, always honestly
intending the reform, always hesitates a little too long,
with doubts that are often intellectual in origin and
sometimes wise in their nature, but foolish at the moment.
He hesitates to sign the decree of the 4th of August;<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">[52]</a>
he hesitates about this and that expression in the Declaration
of rights. He has a very strong reluctance to
forego the absolute veto; all through September you can
hear the machinery creaking, and it gets worse as the
autumn advances.</p>

<p>Meanwhile in Paris two forces are at work to aid
this crisis at Versailles. First, the popular societies,
notably that meeting in the Palais Royal, which now
is almost a Parliament, where every prominent Parisian
name is heard, and whence those curious documents,
parodies of the old-fashioned decrees, emanate,<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87"></a>[87]</span>
unfrequently with the power to cause insurrection.
Secondly, the price of food, especially of flour, is rising
rapidly. We have explained in the first chapter how
largely the lack of food in the towns was due to vicious
interference with exchange: when such is the prime
cause of economic trouble, the least disturbance aggravates
it to a high degree; thus it was that while the
harvest was being gathered in the north, and in the south
had been already stored, the supply of cereals in the
capital was all but exhausted.</p>

<p>Thus curiously side by side (and partly overlapping)
the intense political interest of the voting class and the
growing misery of the populace ran fatally towards the
days of October. At the Cordeliers, innocent of pedants,
practical, alert, debating with open doors, there met the
two revolutionary interests, those of the politicians and
of the poor; and this is why they are heard so loudly
in September, and why Danton and his district become
famous just before the march on Versailles.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the assembly of electors
at the Hotel de Ville had guided Paris through the great
storm of July 13-17; their powers were vague and unconstitutional,
for they had been elected at first merely to
choose Deputies for Paris, nevertheless it was they who
had made Bailly mayor, who had nominated Lafayette,
who had formed the National Guard, and who had been
confirmed by the King in their functions of a provisional
municipality. It was acting on this decree which gave
them a right to take political initiative, that on Thursday,
July 23, they had sent a circular to the sixty districts
asking each to name two members. The hundred and
twenty so elected were to draw up a plan for a new
municipality; they met, did so, and the result of their
labours was the issue on August 30th of a scheme for a
new municipal system, upon which the primaries in every
districts were asked to debate. Somewhat illogically,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_88"></a>[88]</span>
however, the complicated document was accompanied by
a writ demanding the immediate election in each district
of five members to form the new corporation. In other
words, the primaries were asked to form a new municipality,
to give it full powers, and then to debate
academically upon what they had done.</p>

<p>It may have been only a blunder, but the Cordeliers
took alarm at what certainly seemed to be a plot on the
part of the Moderates. The project and the writ had
reached them on <i>Sunday</i> August 30th; by Thursday, September
3rd, they had arrived at a decision to refuse the
writ. They argued that it was absurd to ask the districts
to debate on a project <i>after</i> its most essential part had been
realised, namely, the election of deputies. On that election,
its methods, the powers of the members, and so forth,
the greater part of the discussions would turn, and by
the time the districts had arrived at such and such conclusions,
or had modified the powers of their deputies
in such and such a fashion, those deputies would already
have been sitting for some time as a municipal council,
would be helping to frame or to modify the new municipal
system on their own account. It would have been
not only confusion but an encroachment on the principle
by which (nominally) the districts had been consulted,
viz., that the electors themselves in their districts should
thrash out the new system. The Cordeliers named commissioners
who examined the whole matter, and, on
Saturday, the 12th, definitely rejected the writ. Nevertheless,
as the other districts had all obeyed and had
elected their five members each, the Cordeliers elected
their five under protest<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> on the following Monday, the
14th, and sent them, bound by a strict oath, to the Hotel
de Ville.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_89"></a>[89]</span></p>

<p>This little incident merits a very considerable degree
of attention, although it has been somewhat neglected by
the historians, and even by Danton’s biographers. It was
the first skirmish in that decisive struggle between the
democratic idea, headed by the Cordeliers, and the limited
suffrage of the first municipality—a struggle which is at
the root of all the action of Paris. It is the first act
of Danton in an official position; in much that the
Cordeliers had done he was evidently the leader, but in
this document we learn that he is elected president of
the district, and see his name signed.<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">[55]</a> And finally,
there appears here, for the first time in the Revolution,
the <i>Mandat Imperatif</i>, the brutal and decisive weapon of
the democrats, the binding by an oath of all delegates,
the mechanical responsibility against which Burke had
pleaded at Bristol, which the American constitution
vainly attempted to exclude in its principal election, and
which must in the near future be the method of our
final reforms. It had been raised, and Danton had raised
it; for these five deputies, before being permitted to
attend at the Hotel de Ville, swore to a definite plan
of action whose terms were dictated at the general meeting
of the district.</p>

<p>The struggle as it continues becomes of greater importance,
until, within four months, it faces Danton
himself in the Hotel de Ville; but we cannot describe
its further steps until we have mentioned the next action
with which the Cordeliers are associated, and in which
their decisive rôle is largely determined by the Revolutionary
championship which this brush with authority
had given them.</p>

<p>We have described above the various forces that were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_90"></a>[90]</span>
fatally converging to form the whirlpool of October—the
hesitancy of the King, the desperate intrigues of the Court,
the intense political excitement of the Palais Royal and of
the electors in Paris, the growing misery of the populace.
We have pointed out how the Cordeliers, with their popular
audience and popular sympathies, were at once the only
great debating place in Paris and the only spot where the
forces of voters and non-voters could join hands. Add
to this the effect of the protest described above and of
the position such a struggle gave them in the democratic
movement, and their importance in the days of October
becomes evident.</p>

<p>It was at the close of September that all these tendencies
came together. Again, after three months of
silence, the reaction found its voice, and the King’s uncertainty,
the Court faction’s plotting, culminated in the
arrival at Versailles of military reinforcements. The body-guards
were doubled, and there marched in the Regiment
of Flanders—a body (by the way) to whose name clings
something of comedy, and whose raggedness has passed
into a marching legend. This book is not the place to
describe at any length what followed, save in its connection
with Danton and the Club. On Thursday, October
the 1st, a famous dinner was given by the body-guard
to the newly arrived regiment. The Court dealt with
excellent material, and with the wine and the night the
admirable feelings of loyalty arose: the poor King assumed
the halo of a leader to these men whose regimental traditions
were knit up with the monarchy; soldiers, they
appreciated his defeat, and, being comrades, they were
angry at his loneliness. They greeted him with a passionate
song, destroyed the three-coloured cockades, and pinned
on the white ribbons; for the first time in a year enthusiasm
was with the beleaguered, though it lasted but a
few hours and stretched to but a few hundred of men.
To Paris, hearing of it on the next day, Friday, it was a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_91"></a>[91]</span>
challenge, discussed, oddly enough, with some contradictions
and confusions. Men talked of Bouillé, the courtier,
and his frontier command at Metz; people were afraid
that he would protect the King in some flight to the
provinces; there ran a vague uneasiness and a fear of
anarchy with the King’s disappearance; above all, in the
minds of the politicians a fear of armed reaction, and in
the minds of the starving a terror that the reforms which
were so material to them were in jeopardy. Still, all
Saturday the waters only moved at the surface, and you
might have thought that Paris was incapable of any
combined action.</p>

<p>But if the reaction contained a powerful integrating
force in the Court party, Paris also possessed it in a small
meeting and in one supremely energetic man. On the
morning of Sunday, a day when there was leisure to read,
the walls were placarded with the manifesto of the Cordeliers.
It demanded an insurrection, and was signed
with Danton’s name. On Monday morning they rang the
tocsin at the belfry of the convent, and the battalion of
the district was drawn up and armed. De Crèvecœur, their
commander, prevented them marching in a body, but a
number of the district determined to merge with the
crowd. Meanwhile, the mob gathered from every quarter,
especially the Place de Grève—a true mob this time, and
accompanied, as all the world knows, by a crowd of women,
poured up the Versailles road. They made a hideous
night in the great space before the palace. Lafayette
followed tardily with his organised volunteers, the National
Guard; but on the Tuesday the palace was forced, and
some of its defenders killed. The royal family came in
their heavy coach down the twelve miles of falling road
into Paris, and, not without some state, they entered the
Tuilleries. The National Assembly followed the King
into the capital.</p>

<p>Thus the second milestone of the Revolution was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_92"></a>[92]</span>
passed. Of all the revolutionary days, these were the
most purely anarchic. The action was that of men hardly
possessing ideas, but fixed upon a practical thing—the
presence of the King in Paris. It had for its main
object good, and for its method mad anger. Nevertheless,
the instinct of the mob had hit the mark. Like all
sudden actions, it had made issues definite which had
till then been confused. It put an end once and for all
to the idea of crushing the reform at its outset by force;
it gave Paris a mastery over every subsequent action; of
the many ways the Court party might have tried it
reduced them to one only, namely, an organised secret
diplomacy with the object of raising Europe against
France.</p>

<p>As for Louis, we may honestly believe that his capture
was not entirely distasteful to him: as he was less acute,
so he had certainly more common-sense than his wife. If
he was jealous of his dignity, which had been grievously
offended, yet he was very French, patriotic, and not unwilling
to see himself the object of a violent demand.
Everybody saw—the King must have seen it too—that
the whole uprising was monarchic. There was not any
class more monarchic in France than the poor. The King
as their father was an idea bred in them for centuries, and
he knew that they made of him a kind of providence who
could give them food; that they rose not to make him less
powerful, but to make a faction impotent. And there was
nothing distasteful to him in being a King of the French,
seated in the midst of his great capital, and on the summit,
as it were, of a new order. October did not threaten to
make him less, but more of a King. It was later, in
questions that affected the heart, especially in matters
of religion, that the gulf opened between Louis and his
people.</p>

<p>With the King, then, at the Tuilleries, with the
Assembly some three hundreds yards off down the gardens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93"></a>[93]</span>
in the riding-school of the palace,<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">[56]</a> we enter the long
avenue by which Paris obtains the initiative in every
subsequent reform. Let us turn, then, to follow once
more the action of the society and the man who,
between them, determine the direction of Paris for the
next three years.</p>

<p>The quarrel which was sketched earlier in this chapter,
the assault of the district upon the Moderates, continued
throughout the autumn and winter. Four times running
Danton is elected President,<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> and it is under his guidance
that the affair proceeds. While the Assembly are making
a new France at the Manège, organising the departments,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">[58]</a>
fixing the restricted suffrage,<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">[59]</a> creating the communes
over all France,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> the Cordeliers are making the spirit of
a new Paris on the hill over the river; this spirit will
conquer and transform the debaters in the Parliament.</p>

<p>On the 22nd of October they follow up their previous
action. Already before the revolt they had come into
collision with the municipality: in this new resolution they
protest against a demand of Lafayette for regular courts-martial
in the National Guard. The protest had a
meaning, for Lafayette was raising an armed bourgeois
power, but the motive of the Cordeliers was mainly the
desire to harass the Moderates. A week later the Municipal
Council gave its reply to these various encroachments
on the part of the Cordeliers in a decree of the
29th of October: it condemned the action of the district
in three definite points: first, its habit of passing resolutions
like a small municipal body; secondly, its habit of asking
the fifty-nine other districts to pass spontaneous resolutions
on important matters; thirdly (and most important),<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_94"></a>[94]</span>
its revolutionary action in demanding an oath from its
delegates. In this last point the purely democratic idea
on the one hand, and the senatorial theories of the
Moderates on the other, came face to face, and on that
point the issue turned. On the 2nd of November the
district replied by a resolution denying the right of the
elected to control the electors, and especially condemning
the interference of the Hotel de Ville with debates in
the districts. On the 12th, ten days later, they came
out into the open with a resolution that was like a
declaration of war against Bailly and Lafayette; they
drew up a form of oath which their five deputies were to
swear, and this oath bound the members of the district
not only to obey the district in all its resolutions, but also
to admit that they could be dismissed after being called
upon three times to resign by a majority of the district.
It was the full doctrine of delegacy and of the corporate
will.</p>

<p>Only two of the five members took the oath, the
rest resigned and were promptly replaced by others,
and these presented themselves at the Hotel de Ville
on November 16th. Condorcet was President of the
municipal body, and practically everybody there was
furious against the Cordeliers. They demanded a
recital of the causes which had led to the dismissal
of the three members, and then they insisted on hearing
the terms of the famous oath that bound the five
deputies. Of the two who had consented to take the
oath in the first instance, one (Peyrilhe) muttered excuses,
but the other (Croharé), who seems to have been more of
a true Cordelier, was very proud of the position he held,
and would have explained the true doctrine at great
length, had not the meeting cut him short by a vigorous
vote, declaring all such oaths inadmissible, sending away
the three new members, and recalling those who had
resigned. On the next day the municipality broke the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_95"></a>[95]</span>
law. It turned Croharé out, but by a very small vote, in
which many abstained.<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> Of course such an action was
not to be tolerated, for it would have made the majority
of the municipality able to end all opposition or debate,
and the mistake of Condorcet was Danton’s opportunity.</p>

<p>Every character he possesses is apparent in the struggle
that follows. He carries it on with something of the
diplomacy that later was matched against all Europe: he
secures his allies and isolates his enemies: he pleads to
convince and to obtain official support, not (as do so many
of his contemporaries) in order to follow a line of thought.
In a word, he is <i>habile</i>, and practically he succeeds.</p>

<p>Observe the quality of this action. When the
district meets on the 17th (while the Commune was
dismissing Croharé), Danton sees the importance of keeping
its debate in bounds. That gathering, which is so enamoured
of abstract rights, is suddenly bound down by the
superior ability of its chairman: the discussion is made
to follow points of legal technicality, and Danton imposes
upon the Cordeliers so strict a discipline for one day, that
two points alone emerge from the speeches, and they are
precisely the two which could be used as arguments. (1.)
That the Commune was <i>provisional</i>, and its <i>raison d’être</i>
was the formation of a new municipal system: in such
cases (say the Cordeliers) the subjects of the experiment
must remain masters, and it would be absurd to take away
the power of control, that later would have to be readmitted
when the new municipal constitution should be sent to
the districts for acceptance or rejection: in a word, they
argued on the <i>vice de raisonnement</i>—the want of logic—in
the Commune’s action. (2.) They appealed to
the Assembly—that is, they recognised and submitted to
the centre of national power.<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> The Assembly was in
a dilemma. It was in full sympathy with the Moderates<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_96"></a>[96]</span>
with Bailly and with Lafayette; on the other hand, it
could not, without a great loss of prestige, deny the
very principles upon which its own power rested. Their
committee on the subject desired a complete admission of
the Cordeliers’ claim; the Assembly rejected this, and tried
to compromise by saying that both parties should go back
to “the state of things of November 10th”—that is, to the
state of things before the oath and before the whole
trouble. The compromise would not hold. The deputies
thus legally reinstated all resigned (except Croharé) on
account of the feeling in their district, and the Cordeliers
then, with full legality, re-elected their popular champions
of the <i>Mandat Imperatif</i>.</p>

<p>The Commune took its defeat ill. They tried to prove
that the old members had not really resigned. They sent
a committee to interview them, but the committee came
back with proof that the resignation was voluntary, and
finally, on November 28, the little company of democrats
were sworn in to a very ungracious and unwilling Assembly,
and Danton had won.</p>

<p>My readers must excuse so detailed an account of an
event which is empty of picturesque detail and which
is so small a part of that fertile winter. From the point
of view of general history it is the first appearance of
the <i>Mandat Imperatif</i> in action; and from the point of
view of Danton’s rôle in the Revolution it is of the
utmost importance, though it is so insignificant a catalogue
of quarrels. It was Danton’s first victory, and it
was decisive. It put a wedge, as it were, into the gate
that he was forcing open by persistent effort; and though
his final position in the administration of Paris is won
after many further failures, it is a direct consequence of
this success in 1789. At the same time it showed that
a young, loud-voiced lawyer of the middle class could
have that one necessary quality of skill lying under the
coarse exterior; he could play the game with the subtlety<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_97"></a>[97]</span>
of appreciation which was so necessary in the terrible
year of invasion, the keen aptitude of the mind which
the visionaries were too unpractised, the demagogues too
brutal to attain. That aptitude had appeared in Danton’s
pleading, and was to make him during the war a man
necessary to France.</p>

<p>It was a month or six weeks after these events, on
some date in January which we can only fix by indirect
evidence, that Danton was himself elected to represent
the district. The restless society had caused a further
resignation, and five new members came to the Hotel
de Ville.<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> He came unimportant, effaced, known merely
as a demagogue, into that municipal assembly which
contained the most dignified, the most learned, and the
most representative of the noblesse and higher bourgeoisie,
to sit under the frowns and endure the silence,
and at first the contempt, of Condorcet, of D’Espagnac,
of the academicians Laharpe and Suard, the astronomer
De Cassini, Lavoisier, De Moreton-Chabrillant captain
of the guard, Bailly and Lafayette themselves. And in
the very first hours of his presence, before he had taken
the oath, an incident occurred which clinched, as it were,
the disfavour in which he was regarded, and which for a
year put him in the background of a council which he
was destined ultimately to master. I refer to what is
known as the incident of Marat.</p>

<p>Marat was more of a gentleman than Danton; it is
also fair to say that he was nearly mad. No two men
could have been more different than the learned, irritable,
visionary physician and the young, healthy country lawyer
who was for a moment his champion. The one has
met continually the ruling class, and has suffered from<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_98"></a>[98]</span>
its insolence and privilege; the other has known professional
friends indeed of the first rank, but has passed
his life with the trading middle class, and has entered
perhaps during all his career in Paris not one salon, nor
met perhaps one of the brilliant women of his time.</p>

<p>Marat presented from the outset the first problem to
be faced by a people who are testing liberty. He was a
journalist and pamphleteer of unbridled license, one of
those who cannot find in themselves that control which,
when it is absent in public writers, can only be supplanted
by the cumbersome, dangerous, and necessary
machinery of the Censor. Not for money, of course, nor
for any unworthy motive, but for the excellent end of
attaining freedom, this morbid mind poured out the
wildest, the most sensational, and the most dangerous
appeals.</p>

<p>Now the courts were in process of transition; rapidly
as the reform had marched since the summer, much of
the old judicial procedure necessarily remained, and
among the rest a body known as the Châtelet, whose
removal was already planned, but which had to be maintained
until the new system could be put in working
order. It was very typical of the old regime. A body
of privileged lawyers, many of them young and ignorant,
holding their places by inheritance or purchase, and
charged with what we may call the police of the capital.
They had formerly possessed (and it had not yet been
abolished in detail) the power of arbitrary arrest. They
drew their name from the heavy fortress which had once
defended the Pont au Change when Paris was confined
to the island of the Cité; some of its walls dated at
latest from the Norman siege of the tenth century, and
beneath it were cellars which had for centuries been the
prisons of those arrested in Paris by the city guard. It
stood gloomy and strong on the site of the modern place
that bears its name, dominating the close streets of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_99"></a>[99]</span>
Boucherie, and possessing in its associations and its
waning power all the qualities that had made the Bastille
odious to the people. It may be imagined how the jurisdiction
which it contained was bound to attract the chief
efforts of the reformers; it could not, however, cease to
exercise its functions until there was some more liberal
institution to supply its place, and it came of necessity
into violent collision with that spirit which was determined
to break down by force what the resolutions of
the Assembly had abolished in theory, but had not yet
supplanted in fact.</p>

<p>The principal object of Marat’s tirades was the
moderate town council, and especially Bailly. Moreover,
the worthy astronomer was an admirable butt. He
assumed a livery, and put a fine coat-of-arms on his
carriage, and, while he weakly opposed the rising democracy
of Paris, he was very strong in the matter of
pomposity. Marat was called to the bar of the Commune
to answer for these attacks upon the mayor on the
28th of September. A warrant for his arrest was made
out by the Châtelet on the 6th of October, but the day
was too critical for an action of police against an
individual. On the 8th another warrant was sent out,
and Marat fled to a hiding-place up on Montmartre, from
which, like a mad prophet on a hill-top, he pamphleteered
the city at his feet. His quarrels, therefore (though very
different in kind) were contemporaneous with the important
struggle between the Cordeliers and the Municipality
which are detailed above. The two attacks began
to merge in December.</p>

<p>Marat, on the 12th of that month, was hunted out of
his retreat, and brought before a lower court, but so confused
were the powers of the Châtelet in this period of its
reform and extinction that the prosecution was dropped.
Emboldened by this failure on the part of his opponents,
he came to live and print his sheet openly in the Rue des<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_100"></a>[100]</span>
Fossés St. Germains—that is, in the midst of the district
of the Cordeliers. What followed is well known. At a
moment when the struggle between the district and the
Hotel de Ville is at its height, just after the scene in
which Danton’s deputation had protested against the
mayor’s commission to the militia officers, while the
insulting irony of the term “my lord” was still ringing
in Bailly’s ears, and when Danton himself had been
actually elected for the district, and was present in the
Municipality on the point of taking the oath—when all
these causes of quarrel were, so to speak, met in one
date, the Moderates determined to strike. Marat was
pouring out his impossible diatribes from the territory of
the rebellious district, and no opportunity could be more
favourable. The Châtelet issued once more the warrant
for his arrest, and this time it was supported by Lafayette,
who promised to lend four thousand of the National
Guard.</p>

<p>Now note the importance of what follows. Neither
side in the struggle of the autumn had definitely won.
The National Assembly had temporised, the advantage of
the Cordeliers in the matter of the disputed elections had
been achieved by a trick, and in the dead-lock between
two principles, the central power of the Municipality and
the local autonomy of the district, neither of the two
theories was based upon tradition, neither even (in the
confusion of rapid reforms) could justify itself by a definite
pronouncement of the law. On the one side was the
theory of a highly restricted suffrage, government by a
class socially refined and lying with the nobility rather
than with the people; this side was determined to form
an army to support their politics, and it was they who,
when they did act at last, achieved—but much too late—the
sharp and sanguinary reaction of July 1791. On the
other side was the desire for a wide, later for a universal,
suffrage; a determination to emphasise in the development<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_101"></a>[101]</span>
of the Revolutionary theory, equality and the general
will, rather than order and the practical working of new
laws; a political attitude which was to lead the Revolution
into the intense idealism of 1792, and to end by
declaring the Republic. And all this was represented in
the demand which, of its nature, is the expression of extreme
democracy—I mean the demand for local autonomy,
the idea that an act of government is most just when
it emanates not even from representatives, but from the
lips of the governed themselves.</p>

<p>Such were the two forces opposed to one another in
the affair of Marat—forces which, if not in all France, were
in Paris at least the two great camps of the Revolution.
Already the district had declared its intention to protect
the liberty of the press within its boundaries,<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">[64]</a> and had
been wise enough to specially condemn Marat’s violence;
already had it named a committee of five to see that no
arbitrary arrest should take place in its territory,<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> when
Lafayette sent his militia, cavalry and infantry, on the
22nd of January to help the arrest of Marat. Not content
with the 3000 men thus employed, he clinched the
matter with cannon, placing a couple of pieces at the
end of the Rue des Fossés St. Germains.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> He was determined
to settle things by force, and beat the extremists
with their own weapons. His effort did not find force
opposed to it, as he had hoped; it broke itself in the
most unexpected manner upon the legal ability of
Danton.</p>

<p>The district might have raised, all told, 1500 men,
and it possessed two pieces of artillery; but Danton
was far too wise to use them in such a cause as
that of defending Marat. A street fight, and one in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_102"></a>[102]</span>
which the Cordeliers would have been infallibly beaten,
would have ruined the future chances of their politics.
He armed no one, and did not add a single man to
the small guard which each district kept permanently
drilled, but he assigned them as their guard-room for the
week the ground-floor of Marat’s house. Then he went
there himself with his four companions on the newly
elected committee, and awaited developments.</p>

<p>The great body of the National Guard were massed
in their blue and white at the end of the street, their two
pieces sweeping it, and there was opposed to them nothing
but a small crowd and few arguments. Through their
ranks, and accompanied by a small detachment, came the
two officers or policemen of the Châtelet.<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> They presented
their writ, and Plainville, the commander of the
little detachment that accompanied them, asked to be
allowed to place sentries at the door. The commissioners
gave them leave with the greatest pleasure in the world,
but when the officers presented their warrant, the opportunity
which Danton had been waiting for with some
anxiety presented itself. With a slovenliness that was
part and parcel of the old regime, the Châtelet had not
made out a new warrant, but had issued the old one
which had done duty on the 8th of October.</p>

<p>Now, since that date the Assembly had passed several
important changes in the criminal law, notably one in the
same month October which declared that “no warrant
for arrest can be issued against a householder save in
case of those charges which, if proved, would lead to
imprisonment.”<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> A very obvious principle; but in
France of the old regime to seize a man, hold him, and
even to let him go without trial, merely for some purpose
of the police, was permitted, and the Châtelet may have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_103"></a>[103]</span>
acted upon this tradition. Add to this the fact that the
Assembly had created elective councils in each district to
watch the interest of every inhabitant arrested in criminal
cases,<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> and it is easily apparent that the Châtelet had
committed a great blunder, the value of which a man
trained in the courts and quick to seize an error in
procedure immediately recognised.</p>

<p>Danton affirmed that the writ was illegal, offered
to prove it, and led the officers of the Châtelet to the
hall of the district. There he had the new procedure
read to them, compared it with the date of their warrant,
and so confused the minds of those simple men that
they signed a <i>procès-verbal</i> which declared that, after
hearing such reasons, they doubted how they should act.
They came back escorted by Fabre d’Eglantine through
an angry crowd, and were received by the officers of the
National Guard with some heat. They stood firm, however,
and refused to pursue the arrest until they could
consult with those who sent them, and finally the difficulty
was removed by Danton’s promising to appeal to
the National Assembly and to abide by its decision. The
terms were accepted, the sentries left Marat’s door, and
the troops withdrew.</p>

<p>All this debate and turmoil had taken up the morning
and the luncheon-hour, the Rue des Fossés St.
Germains was evacuated in the early afternoon, and by
four o’clock of that day, 22nd of January 1790, Danton
and his companions were pleading their cause at the bar
of the House. It was the old policy of resorting to the
National Assembly as the last place of appeal, and of
using this principal result of the Revolutionary movement
as a weapon against the Parisian Moderates. The
Assembly found itself in the old dilemma, and adopted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"></a>[104]</span>
the old compromise. By its theory it was democratic; all
its phrases and many of its decrees were based on the
“Contrat Social,” but by its personnel and its connections
it was naturally allied to the high professional class, to
the Baillys and the Lafayettes. It instructed Target
(the President of the fortnight) to write to the district;
he condemned the attitude of the Cordeliers, but Parliament
“relied upon their patriotism to execute the will of
the Assembly.” The district, true to its policy, at once
submitted. They sent Legendre and Testulat to tell the
commander of the forces (who had re-entered the Rue
des Fossés) that they had no longer the right to prevent
the arrest; whereupon he sent in the police and awaited
Marat in the street below. The house was empty, and
Marat was on his way to England, a country with which
he was not unfamiliar, and the vices of whose constitution
had already furnished a theme for his too facile pen.</p>

<p>Such are the details of the story of the famous Friday
in the district of the Cordeliers, events which put Danton’s
name into some prominence, but which also showed him
to the most educated of his time, and therefore to posterity,
in something of a false light. He appears as the
friend of Marat, a man for whom he felt no sympathy,
to whom he was immeasurably superior, and whom he
had supported only because Marat’s quarrel was a tactical
opportunity against the Moderates. To have been from
the outset admitted by the cultured would have been
difficult to him—it would have needed tact, self-effacement,
and silence. For he showed by nature just those rough
gestures and loud, ill-chosen phrases which should be the
sign of a foolish and dangerous man; of what underlay
it, of his learning, his patriotism, and his common-sense
he was to give plenty of proof; but so violent were the
prejudices he had raised that only great length of time
has effaced the false impression of his first appearance
on the scene of politics. <i>We</i> can see the statesman<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105"></a>[105]</span>
clearly, but his contemporaries never quite pierced the
medium that had gathered round him; here and there a
just and noble man, as was Condorcet, would admit his
own misconception, but to the bulk of the gentlemen in
power he was and remained the demagogue.</p>

<p>Two years of careful action fail to clear him, because,
being already one of those whose superficial qualities
repel the close attention necessary to a just opinion, he
had also the misfortune to enter the arena from the
wrong door. Those who were most with him adored
him, the great bulk of his district-voters signed a fervent
declaration in his favour, and later his immediate friends
are willing to die with him. But the class with which
at heart he had most in common held aloof; he had
succeeded twice in a pitched battle with them; they
apologise for his acquaintance, vilify him in their letters,
and if his name has emerged from all this error, if he
has been given his statue in a time of social order and
reconstruction, it is because this man, who never wrote,
who left only a confused legend of his personality, saved
his country when it was at war with the whole world,
and such actions compel history to inquiry and restitution.</p>

<p>On the 23rd, the day after the trouble, he was sworn
in to the reluctant Commune, and there follow two long
years<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> of patient attempt to gain the place for which he
feels himself fitted, but years (on the whole) of disappointment,
and in which his real position in Paris (I mean the
prominence he held in the thoughts of men) contrasts
curiously with the little part he played.</p>

<p class="tb">1790 contains so great a portion of the Revolution,
and sows the seed of so much future division and civil
war, that it seems ridiculous to confine oneself to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_106"></a>[106]</span>
description of the restricted action of one man who had
not yet even attained power. It will be necessary, however,
to make a survey of this restricted action in order
that we may comprehend the greater rôle of Danton in
the two years that follow.</p>

<p>Danton came, then, with Legendre and the three others
into a city Council very much opposed to him and to the
district whose spirit he had formed. He was not often
heard, and there is no doubt that he deliberately tried to
purchase by silence the more just and equable judgment
of such men as he respected, but who knew him only by
unfavourable report. For the bulk of the Assembly he
cannot but have felt contempt; they had no instinct of
the revolutionary tide; even when they were attempting
to check the movement that Danton represented, they
were inefficient and unworthy opponents, from whom his
eye must have wandered inwards to the great battles that
were preparing.</p>

<p>In the eight months during which he was a member
of the Provisional Commune, that is, from January to
September 1790, his name appears in the debates but
a dozen times.<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> More than half of these are mention of
committees upon which his common-sense and legal training
were of service; in one only, that of February 4,
does he speak on a motion, and that is in support of
Barré to admit the public when the oath was taken: one
other (that on the 19th of March concerning the formation
of a “grand jury”) would be interesting were it not
that the whole gist of the debate was but a repetition of
the much more significant discussion at the Cordeliers.
Finally, there is one little notice which is half-pathetic
and half-grotesque: he is one of the committee of twenty-four
charged with the duty of “presenting their humble
thanks, with the mayor at their head,” to the King for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_107"></a>[107]</span>
giving the municipality a marble bust of himself. But
every entry is petty and unimportant: Danton at the
Provisional Municipality of 1790 is deliberately silent—he
can do nothing.</p>

<p>If we turn, however, to a field in which he was more
at home, we find him during that year more than ever
the leader of the Cordeliers, which itself becomes more
than ever the leader of Paris.</p>

<p>There are two important features in the part he
plays at the assemblies of the district during the spring
and summer in which he was a silent member of the
Commune. First, the affair of his arrest; secondly, his
campaign against what may be called “the municipal
reaction.”</p>

<p>As to the first, it is a very minor point in the general
history of the Revolution, but it is of considerable influence
upon the career of Danton himself. When the
affair of Marat was (or should have been) forgotten, the
Châtelet, with that negligence which we have seen them
display in the business of the warrant for Marat’s arrest,
saw fit to launch another warrant, this time for the
arrest of Danton himself. Once more that unpopular
and moribund tribunal put itself on the wrong side of
the law, and once more it chose the most inopportune
moment for its action. It was on the 17th of March,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">[72]</a>
nearly two months after the affair—two months during
which Danton had been hard at work effacing its effects
upon his reputation—that the warrant was issued, and the
motive of arrest given in the parchment was of the least
justifiable kind. In the district meeting of the day,
when the police officers had been taken to the hall of
the Cordeliers, and had had the changes in the law read
out to them, Danton had made use of a violent phrase:<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108"></a>[108]</span>
its actual words were not known; some said that he
had threatened to “call out the Faubourg St. Antoine,
and make the jaws of the guard grow white.” Other
witnesses refused to attribute those words to him, but
accused him of saying, “If every one thought as I do,
we should have twenty thousand men at our back;” his
friends admitted that some angry and injudicious speech,
such as he was often guilty of, had escaped him, but
they affirmed that he had added, “God forbid that such
a thing should happen; the cause is too good to be so
jeopardised.”</p>

<p>Whatever he said (and probably he himself could
not accurately have remembered), the place and the time
were privileged. It was a test case, but the logic of such
a privilege was evident. Here you have deliberative
assemblies to which are intrusted ultimately the formation
of a government for Paris: what is said in such a
constituent meeting, however ill-advised, must in the
nature of things be allowed to pass; if not, you limit the
discussion of the primary, and if you limit that discussion
you vitiate the whole theory upon which the new constitution
was being framed. It must be carefully remembered
that we are not dealing with deliberative bodies
long established, possessed of the central power, and holding
privilege by tradition and by their importance in the
State; we are dealing with the elementary deliberative
assemblies in a period which, rightly or wrongly, was
transforming the whole State upon one perfectly definite
political theory—namely, that these primary assemblies
were the only root and just source of power. When,
therefore, Parisian opinion rose violently in favour of the
president of a district so attacked, when three hundred
voters out of five signed a petition in Danton’s favour,
when he was re-elected president of the district twelve
days after the issue of the warrant, it was because the
whole body of the electors felt a great and justifiable fear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_109"></a>[109]</span>
of what was left of the old regime. The Châtelet had
acted so, not from a careful appreciation of public danger—to
fend off which temporary powers had been given
it—but because it was blind with old age; because it
dated from a time and was composed of a set of men
who hated all deliberative assemblies, and it was justly
thought that if such actions were justified, the whole
system of revolutionary Paris was in danger.</p>

<p>As though in proof of the false view that the Châtelet
took of their man, on the 19th of March, two days after
the warrant was issued, Danton was urging the replacement
of the Châtelet by a Grand Jury; he had an
admiration and a knowledge of the old English system,
and it was against a man attempting so wise a reform
that the last relic of the old jurisprudence was making
an attack.</p>

<p>An appeal was lodged with the National Assembly,
and Anthoine read a long report to the Assembly upon
May 18. This report was strongly in favour of Danton.
It was drawn up by a special committee—not partisan in
any way—and after examining all the evidence it came
to this conclusion against the Châtelet. Nevertheless
the House, a great body of nearly a thousand men, to
most of whom the name of Danton meant only a loud
Radical voice, hesitated. To adopt the report might have
irretrievably weakened the Châtelet, and the National
Assembly was extremely nervous on the subject of order
in Paris. It ended by an adjournment. The report
remained in Danton’s favour; he was not arrested, but
the affair was unfortunate for him, and threw him back
later at a very important occasion, when he might have
entered into power peaceably himself and at a peaceable
time.</p>

<p>But while this business was drawing to its close,
during the very months of April and May which saw his
partial vindication, another and a far more momentous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_110"></a>[110]</span>
business was occupying the Cordeliers—a matter in which
they directed all their energy towards a legal solution,
but in which, unfortunately for the city, they failed.</p>

<p>Ever since the days of October—earlier if you will—there
had been arising a strong sentiment, to which I
have alluded more than once, and which, for lack of a
better name, may be called the Moderate reaction in
Paris. It is difficult to characterise this complex body
of thought in one adjective, and I cannot lengthen a
chapter already too prolonged by a detailed examination
of its origin and development. Suffice it to say that
from the higher bourgeoisie (generally speaking), from
those who were in theory almost Republican, but whose
lives were passed in the artificial surroundings of wealth,
and finally from the important group of the financiers,
who of all men most desired practical reform, and who
of all men most hated ideals; from these three, supported
by many a small shopkeeper or bureaucrat, came
a demand, growing in vigour, for a conservative municipal
establishment—one that should be limited in its
basis, almost aristocratic in quality, and concerned very
much with the maintenance of law and order and very
little with the idea of municipal self-government.</p>

<p>It is a character to be noted in the French people,
this timidity of the small proprietor and his reliance
upon constituted authority. It is a matter rarely observed,
and yet explaining all Parisian history, that this
sentiment does not mark off a particular body of men,
but, curiously enough, is found in the mind of nearly
every Frenchman, existing side by side with another set
of feelings which, on occasion, can make them the most
arrant idealists in the world.</p>

<p>For the moment this intense desire for order was
uppermost in the minds of those few who were permitted
to vote. In the Cordeliers it was the other character of
the Parisian that was emphasised and developed. They<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_111"></a>[111]</span>
were determined on democracy, like everybody else; but,
unlike the rest, they were not afraid of the dangerous
road. They were inspired and led by a man whose one
great fault was a passionate contempt of danger. On
this account, though they are taxpayers and bourgeois,
lawyers, physicians, men of letters and the like, they do
all they can to prevent the new municipal system from
coming into play, but they fail.</p>

<p>Now, consider the Assembly. That great body was
justly afraid of Paris; indeed, the man who was head
and shoulders above them all—Mirabeau—was for leaving
Paris altogether. The Assembly, again, had the whole
task of re-making France in its hands, and it could not
but will that Paris, in the midst of which it sat, should be
muzzled. Through all the debates of the Provisional
Commune it could easily be seen that Bailly and Lafayette
were winning, and that the Parliament would be even
more Moderate than they. Three points were the centres
of the battle: first, the restricted suffrage which was to
be established;<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> secondly, the power which was to be exercised
over the new Commune by the authorities of the
Department; thirdly, the suppression of those sixty
democratic clubs, the districts, and their replacement by
forty-eight sections, so framed as specially to break up
the ties of neighbourhood and association, which the first
of the Revolution had developed. It was aimed especially
at the Cordeliers.</p>

<p>Against the first point the Cordeliers had little to
say. Oddly enough, the idea of universal suffrage, which
is so intimate a part of our ideas on the Revolution, was
hardly thought of in early 1790. Against the second
they debated, but did not decree; it was upon the third
that they took most vigorous action. The law which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112"></a>[112]</span>
authorised the new municipal scheme was passed on May
the 27th, and, faithful to their policy, the Cordeliers did
not attempt to quarrel with the National Assembly, but
they fought bitterly against the application of the law
by Bailly and his party. The law was signed by the
King on June the 27th, and on the same day the mayor
placarded the walls, ordering an immediate installation
of the new system. The 27th was a Saturday. Within
a week the new sections were to be organised, and on
the Monday, July 5, the voting was to begin. The very
next day, the 28th, the Cordeliers protested in a vigorous
decree, in which they called on the fifty-nine other
districts to petition the National Assembly to make a
special exception of the town of Paris, to consider the
great federation of July 14, which should be allowed
to pass before the elections, and finally to give the city
time to discuss so important a change. All through the
week, on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of July, they published
vigorous appeals. They were partially successful, but in
their main object—the reconstruction of the aristocratic
scheme and the arousing of public spirit against it—they
entirely failed. Bailly is elected mayor on August 2 by
an enormous majority—practically 90 per cent. The
old districts disappear, and, like every other, the famous
Cordeliers are merged in the larger section of the Théâtre
Français. It may not sit in permanence; it may not
(save on a special demand of fifty citizens) meet at all; it
is merely an electoral unit, and in future some 14,000
men out of a city of nearly a million are to govern all.
The local club, directing its armed force and appealing to
its fellows, is abolished. Danton then has failed.</p>

<p>But, as we shall see later, the exception became the
rule. No mechanical device could check the Revolution.
The demand for permanent sections is continuous and
successful. From these divisions, intended to be mere
marks upon a map, come the cannon of the 10th of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_113"></a>[113]</span>
August, and it is the section of the Théâtre Français,
wherein the traditions and the very name of the Cordeliers
were to have been forgotten, that first in Europe
declared and exercised the right of the whole people to
govern.</p>

<p>If I may repeat a common-place that I have used
continually in this book, the tide of the Revolution in
Paris was dammed up with a high barrier; its rise could
not be checked, and it was certain to escape at last with
the force and destructive energy of a flood.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_IV">CHAPTER IV<br />
<span class="smaller">THE FALL OF THE MONARCHY</span></h2>

</div>

<p>I have taken as a turning-point in the career of Danton
the municipal change which marks the summer of 1790,
concluding with that event the first chapter of his political
action, and making it the beginning of a new phase.
Let me explain the reasons that have led me to make
such a division at a moment that is marked by no
striking passage of arms, of policy, or of debate.</p>

<p>In the first place, a recital of Danton’s life must of
necessity follow the fortunes of the capital. The spirit
of the people whose tribune he was (their growing
enthusiasms and later their angers)—that spirit is the
chief thing to guide us in the interpretation of his
politics, but the mechanical transformations of the city
government form the framework, as it were, upon which
the stuff of Parisian feeling is woven. The detail is
dry and often neglected; the mere passing of a particular
law giving Paris a particular constitution, a system
not unexpected, and apparently well suited to the first
year of the Revolution, may seem an event of but
little moment in the development of the reform; but
certain aspects of the period lend that detail a very
considerable importance. In the rapid transformation
which was remoulding French society, the law, however
new, possessed a strength which, at this hour, we can
appreciate only with difficulty. In a settled and traditional
society custom is of such overwhelming weight
that a law can act only in accordance with it; a sudden<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_115"></a>[115]</span>
change in the machinery of government would break
down of itself—nay, in such a society laws can hardly be
passed save those that the development of tradition
demands. But in a time of revolution this postulate
of social history fails. When a whole people starts out to
make fresh conditions for itself, every decree becomes an
origin; the forces that in more regular periods mould
and control legislative action are, in a time of feverish
reconstruction, increased in power and give an impetus
to new institutions; the energy of society, which in years
of content and order controls by an unseen pressure, is
used in years of revolution to launch, openly and
mechanically, the fabric that a new theory has designed.
Thus you may observe how in the framing of the
American constitution every point in a particular debate
became of vast moment to the United States; thus in our
time the German Empire has found its strength in a set
of arbitrary decrees, all the creation of a decade; thus in
the Middle Ages the Hildebrandine reform framed in the
life of one man institutions which are vigorous after the
lapse of eight hundred years; and thus in the French
Revolution a municipal organisation, new, theoretic, and
mechanical, was strong enough, not indeed to survive so
terrible a storm, but to give to the whole movement a
permanent change of direction.</p>

<p>This, then, is the transitional character of the summer
of 1790, as regards the particular life of Danton and the
particular city of Paris. What the Cordeliers had fought
so hard to obtain as a constitutional reform had failed.
The direct action of the districts upon the municipality
was apparently lost for ever, and the centre of the new
system was in future to be controlled in the expression
of ideas and paralysed in its action. What the Cordeliers
had represented in spirit, though they had not formulated
it in decrees—government by the whole people—was
apparently equally lost. The law of December<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_116"></a>[116]</span>
(that which established the “active and passive citizens”)
was working for Paris as for all France; and
though a suffrage which admitted two-thirds of the male
population to the polls could not be called restrictive, yet
the exception of men working for wages under their
master’s roof, the necessity of a year’s residence, and the
qualification of tax-paying did produce a very narrow
oligarchy in a town like Paris: the artisans were excluded,
and thousands of those governed fell just beyond the
limits which defined the municipal voter. Danton may
receive the provincial delegates, may make his speeches
at the feast in the Bois de Boulogne; but once the organ
of government has been closed to his ideas, the road
towards the democracy lies through illegality and revolt.</p>

<p>Now there is another and a wider importance in this
anniversary of the fall of the Bastille. It is the point at
which we can best halt and survey the beginning of the
heat which turned the Revolution from a domestic reform
of the French nation to a fire capable of changing the
nature of all our civilisation. I do not mean that you
will find those quarrels in the moment; in 1790 there is
nothing of the spirit that overturned the monarchy nor
of the visions that inspired the Gironde; you cannot even
fairly say that there are general threats or mutterings of
war, although the Assembly saw fit to disclaim them: it is
a year before the fear of such dangers arises. But there is
in this summer something to be discovered, namely, an
explanation of why two periods differing so profoundly in
character meet so suddenly and with such sharp contrast
at one point in the history of the movement; it is from
the summer of 1790 and onwards that the laws are
passed, the divisions initiated, which finally alienate the
King, from that lead to his treason, from that rouse
Europe, and from the consequent invasion produce the
Terror, the armies, and the Empire. The mind needs
a link between two such different things as reform and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117"></a>[117]</span>
violence, and because that link is not supplied in the
mere declaration of war or in the mere flight to Varennes,
men commit the error of reading the spirit of the Republic
into the days of Mirabeau, or even of seeing temperate
politics in the apostolic frenzy of ’93. Some, more ignorant
or less gifted than the general reader, explain it by
postulating in the character of the French nation quaint
aberrations which may be proper to the individual, but
which never have nor can exist in any community of
human beings.</p>

<p>Let me recapitulate and define the problem which, as
it seems to me, can be solved by making a pivot of the
anniversary of the States-General.</p>

<p>There are, then, in the story of the Revolution these
two phases, so distinct that their recognition is the foundation
of all just views upon the period. In the first, the
leaders of the nation are bent upon practical reforms; the
monarchy is a machine to hand for their accomplishment;
the sketch of a new France is drawn, the outlines even
begin to be filled by trained and masterly hands. Phrases
will be found abundantly in those thirty months, because
phrases are the christening of ideas, and no nation of
Roman training could attempt any work without clear
definitions to guide it. But these phrases, though often
abstract in the extreme, are never violent, and the oratory
itself of the National Assembly is rarely found to pass the
limits which separate the art of persuasion from the mere
practice of defiance.</p>

<p>In the second phase, for which the name of the Convention
often stands, those subterranean fires which the
crust of tradition and the stratified rock of society had
formerly repressed break out in irresistible eruption.
The creative work of the revolutionary idea realises itself
in a casting of molten metal rather than in a forging,
and the mould it uses is designed upon a conception of
statuary rather than of architecture. The majestic idol<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_118"></a>[118]</span>
of the Republic, in whose worship the nation has since
discovered all its glories and all its misfortunes, is set up
by those artists of the ideal; but they forget, or perhaps
ignore, the terrible penalties that attach to superhuman
attempts, the reactions of an exclusive idealism.</p>

<p>What made the second out of the first? What made
a France which had discussed Sieyès listen to St. Just or
even to Hébert? The answer to this question is to be
discovered in noting the fatal seeds that were sown in
this summer of 1790, and which in two years bore the
fruit of civil war and invasion.</p>

<p>In the first place, that summer creates, as we have
seen, a discontented Paris—a capital whose vast majority
it refuses to train in the art of self-government, and
whose general voice it refuses to hear.</p>

<p>In the second place, it is the moment when the discontent
in the army comes to a head. The open threat
of military reaction on the side of a number of the
officers, their intense animosity against the decrees abolishing
titles, their growing disgust at the privileges
accorded to the private soldiers—all these come face to
face with non-commissioned officers and privates who are
full of the new liberties. These lower ranks contained
the ambitious men whose ability, the honest and loyal
men whose earnestness, were to carry French arms to the
successes of the Revolutionary wars.</p>

<p>In the third place, it is the consummation of the
blunder that attempted to create an established National
Church in France. Before this last misfortune a hundred
other details of these months that were so many mothers
of discord become insignificant. Civil war first muttering
in the South, counter-revolution drilling in Savoy, the
clerical petition of Nîmes, the question of the Alsatian
estates, the Parisian journals postulating extreme democracy,
the Jacobins appearing as an organised and propagandist
body, the prophetic cry of Lameth—all these<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_119"></a>[119]</span>
things were but incidents that would have been forgotten
but for the major cause of tumult, which is to be discovered
in the civil constitution of the clergy.</p>

<p>Of course, the kings would have attacked, but they
were divided, and had not even a common motive. Of
course, also, freedom, in whatever form it came, would
have worked in the moribund body of Europe like a
drug, and till its effect was produced would have been
thought a poison. But against the hatred of every
oppressor would have been opposed a disciplined and a
united people, sober by instinct, traditionally slow in the
formation of judgments, traditionally tenacious of an
opinion when once it had been acquired. It would
have been sufficient glory for the French people to have
broken the insolence of the aggressors, to have had upon
their lists the names of Marceau and of Hoche.</p>

<p>But with the false step that produced civil war, that
made of the ardent and liberal West a sudden opponent,
that in its final effect raised Lyons and alienated half the
southern towns, that lost Toulon, that put the extreme
of fanaticism in the wisest and most loyal minds—such a
generous and easy war was doomed, and the Revolution
was destined to a more tragic and to a nobler history.
God, who permitted this proud folly to proceed from a
pedantic aristocracy, foresaw things necessary to mankind.
In the despair of the philosophers there will arise
on either side of a great battle the enthusiasms which,
from whencever they blow, are the fresh winds of the soul.
Here are coming the heroes and the epic songs for which
humanity was sick, and the scenes of one generation of
men shall give us in Europe our creeds for centuries.
You shall hear the “Chant du Départ” like a great hymn
in the army of the Sambre et Meuse, and the cheers of
men going down on the <i>Vengeur</i>; the voice of a young
man calling the grenadiers at Lodi and Arcola; the noise
of the guard swinging up the frozen hill at Austerlitz.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120"></a>[120]</span>
Already the forests below the Pyrenees are full of the
Spanish guerillas, and after how many hundred years
the love of the tribe has reappeared again above the conventions
that covered it. There are the three colours
standing against the trees in the North and the South;
and the delicate womanly face of Nelson is looking over
the bulwarks of the <i>Victory</i>, with the slow white clouds
and the light wind of an October day above him, and
before him the enemy’s sails in the sunlight and the black
rocks of the coast.</p>

<p>It may be well, at the expense of some digression, to
say why the laws affecting the clergy should be treated as
being of paramount historical importance. They ruined
the position of the King; they put before a very large
portion of the nation not one, but two ideals; and what
regular formation can grow round two dissimilar nuclei?
Finally—a thing that we can now see clearly, though then
the wisest failed to grasp it—they went against the grain
of the nation.</p>

<p>It is a common accusation that the Revolution committed
the capital sin of being unhistorical. Taine’s
work is a long anathema pronounced against men who
dared to deny the dogmas of evolution before those
dogmas were formulated. Such a criticism is erroneous
and vain; in the mouths of many it is hypocritical. The
great bulk of what the Revolution did was set directly
with the current of time. For example: The re-unison
of Gaul had been coming of itself for a thousand years—the
Revolution achieved it; the peasant was virtually
master of his land—it made him so in law and fact;
Europe had been trained for centuries in the Roman law—it
was precisely the Roman law that triumphed in the
great reform, and most of its results, all of its phraseology,
is drawn from the civil code. But in this one feature of
the constitution of the clergy it sinned against the nature
of France. Of necessity the Parliament was formed of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_121"></a>[121]</span>
educated men, steeped in the philosophy of the time, and
of necessity it worked under the eyes of a great city
population. In other words, the statesmen who bungled in
this matter and the artisans who formed their immediate
surroundings were drawn from the two classes which had
most suffered from the faults of the hierarchy in France.</p>

<p>Mirabeau, for example, has passed his life in the
rank where rich abbés made excellent blasphemy; the
artisan of Paris has passed his life unprotected and
unsolicited by the priests, whose chief duty is the maintenance
of human dignity in the poor. Add to this the
Jansenist legend of which Camus was so forcible a relic,
and the Anglo-mania which drew the best intellects into
the worst experiments, and the curious project is inevitable.</p>

<p>In these first essays of European democracy there
was, as all the world knows, a passion for election. In
vain had Rousseau pointed out the fundamental fallacy
of representation in any scheme of self-government. The
example of America was before them; the vicious temptation
of the obvious misled them; and until the hard
lessons of the war had taught them the truth, representation
for its own sake, like a kind of game, seems to
have been an obsession of the upper class in France.
They admitted it into the organisation of the Church.</p>

<p>Now let us look in its detail at this attempt to make
of the Catholic Church in the eighteenth century a
mixture of the administration of Constantine, of the
presbyteries of first centuries, and of the “branch of the
civil service” which has suited so well a civilisation so
different from that of France.</p>

<p>The great feature of this reform was the attempt to
subject the whole clerical organisation to the State. I
do not mean, of course, the establishment of dogmas by
civil discussion, nor the interference with internal discipline;
but the hierarchy was to be elected, from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122"></a>[122]</span>
parish priest to the bishop; the new dioceses were to
correspond to the new Departments, and, most important
of all, their confirmation was not to be demanded from
the Pope, but “letters of communion” were to be sent to
the Head of the Church, giving him notice of the election.</p>

<p>This scheme passed the House on July 12, 1790, two
days before the great feast of the federation. A time
whose intellect was alien to the Church, a class whose
habits were un-Catholic, had attempted a reformation.
Why was the attempt a blunder? Simply because it
was unnecessary. There were certain ideas upon which
the reconstruction of France was proceeding; they have
been constantly alluded to in this book; they are what
the French call “the principles of ’89.” Did they necessarily
affect the Church? Yes; but logically carried out
they would have affected the Church in a purely negative
way. It was an obvious part of the new era to deny
the <i>imperium in imperio</i>. The Revolution would have
stultified itself had it left untouched the disabilities of
Protestants and of Jews, had it continued to support
the internal discipline of the Church by the civil power.
It was logical when it said to the religious orders: “You
are private societies; we will not compel your members
to remain, neither will we compel them to leave their
convents.” (In the decree of February 13, 1790.) It
would have been logical had it said to the Church: “It
may be that you are the life of society; it may be that
your effect is evil; we leave you free to prove your
quality, for freedom of action and competition is our
cardinal principle.” But instead of leaving the Church
free they amused themselves by building up a fantastic
and mechanical structure, and then found that they were
compelling religion to enter a prison. Nothing could be
conceived more useless or more dangerous.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if this scheme as a whole was
futile, there were some details that were necessary results<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123"></a>[123]</span>
of what the clergy themselves had done, and some which,
if not strictly necessary, have at least survived the Revolution,
and are vigorous institutions to-day. It might have
been possible for Rome to seize on these as a basis of
compromise, and it is conceivable, though hardly probable,
that the final scheme might have left the Church
a neutral in the coming wars. But if the councils of the
Holy See were ill-advised, the Parliament was still less
judicious; its extreme sensitiveness to interference from
abroad was coupled with the extreme pedantry of a
Lanjuinais, and the scheme in its entirety was forced
upon Louis. He, almost the only pious man in a court
which had so neglected religion as to hate the people,
wrote in despair to the Pope; but before the answer
came he had signed the law, and in that moment signed
the warrant for his own death and that of thousands of
other loyal and patriotic men.</p>

<p>While these future divisions were preparing, during
the rest of the year 1790 Danton’s position becomes more
marked. We find a little less about him in the official
records, for the simple reason that he has ceased to be a
member of an official body, or rather (since the first Commune
was not actually dissolved till September) he remains
the less noticeable from the fact that the policy which
he represented has been defeated; but his personality is
making more impression upon Paris and upon his enemies.
We shall find him using for the first time moderation, and
for the first time meeting with systematic calumny. He
acquires, though he is not yet of any especial prominence,
the mark of future success, for he is beginning to be singled
out as a special object of attack; and throughout the summer
and autumn he practises more and more that habit
of steering his course which up to the day of his death so
marks him from the extremists.</p>

<p>The failure of his policy, the check which had been
given to the Cordeliers, and the uselessness of their protests<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_124"></a>[124]</span>
on the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of July, had a marked effect
upon the position of Danton even in his own district. He
had been president when they were issued, and his friend
D’Eglantine had been secretary. One may say that the
policy of resistance was Danton’s, and that but for his
leadership it would have been unheard. Hence, when it
has notoriously failed, that great mass of men who (when
there is no party system) follow the event, lost their faith
in him.</p>

<p>Bailly is not only elected by an enormous majority
in all Paris<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> on the 2nd of August, but even Danton’s own
district, now become the Section of the Théâtre Français,
abandoned his policy for the moment. In a poll of 580,
478 votes were given for Bailly.</p>

<p>In this moment of reverse he might with great ease
have thrown himself upon all the forces that were for the
moment irregular. The Federation of July had brought
to Paris a crowd of deputies from the Departments, and to
these provincials the good-humour and the comradeship
of this Champenois had something attractive about it. In
a Paris which bewildered them they found in him something
that they could understand. In a meeting held by
a section of them in the Bois de Boulogne it is Danton
who is the leading figure. When the deputies of Marseilles
ask for Chenier’s “Charles IX.,” it is Danton who gets it
played for them at the Théâtre Français in spite of the
opposition of the Court; and again it is Danton who is
singled out during an <i>entr’acte</i> for personal attack by the
loyalists, who had come to hiss the play.<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">[75]</a></p>

<p>The unrepresented still followed him, and he still
inspired a vague fear in the minds of men like Lafayette.
Innocent of any violence, he stood (to those who saw him
from a great distance) for insurrection. He was remembered<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_125"></a>[125]</span>
as the defender of Marat, and Marat in turn annoyed him
by repeated mention and praise in his ridiculous journal.
Note also that the time was one in which the two camps
were separating, though slowly, and the rôle of a demagogue
would have been as tempting to a foolish man on
the Radical, as the rôle of true knight was to so many
foolish men on the Conservative side. Each part was
easy to play, and each was futile.</p>

<p>Danton refused such a temptation. He, almost alone
at that moment (with the exception, in a much higher
sphere, of Mirabeau), was capable of being taught by
defeat. He desired a solid foundation for action. Here
were certain existing things: the club of the Cordeliers,
which had for a while failed him; the Friends of the Constitution,
which were a growing power; the limited suffrage
of Paris, which he regretted, but which was the only
legal force he could appeal to; the new municipal constitution,
which he had bitterly opposed, but which was
an accomplished fact. Now it is to all these realities that
he turns his mind. He will re-capture his place in the
Section, and make of the quarter of the Odéon a new
République des Cordeliers. He will re-establish his position
with Paris. He will attempt to enter, and perhaps
later to control, this new municipality. It was for such
an attitude that St. Just reproached him so bitterly in the
act of accusation of April 1794, while at the moment he
was adopting that attitude he was the mark of the most
violent diatribe from the Conservatives. Nothing defines
Danton at this moment so clearly as the fact that he
alone of the popular party knew how to be practical and
to make enemies.</p>

<p>The month of August may be taken as the time when
Danton had to be most careful if he desired to preserve
his place and to avoid a fall into violence and unreason.
It was the 2nd of that month (as we have said) that
saw Bailly’s election, the 5th that gave Danton a personal<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_126"></a>[126]</span>
shock, for on that date he received, for an office which
he really coveted and for which he was a candidate, but
193 votes out of over 3000 present.</p>

<p>From that moment he devotes all his energy to reconstruction.
The first evidence of his new attitude appears
with the early days of September. Already the old meeting
of the Cordeliers had been changed into the club, and
already his influence was gaining ground again in the
debates and in the local battalion of the National Guard,
when the news of Nancy came to Paris.</p>

<p>A conflict between the National Guard and the people,
an example of that with which Lafayette continually
menaced Paris—the conflict of the armed bourgeoisie and
the artisans, or rather of the militia used as a professional
army against the people—this had happened at last. It
was an occasion for raving. Marat raved loudly, and the
royalists gave vent to not a little complacent raving on
their side. In the great question whether the army was
to be democratic or not, whether reaction was to possess
its old disciplined arm, it would seem that reaction had
won, and France had seen a little rehearsal of what in ten
months was to produce the 17th of July.</p>

<p>In such conditions the attitude of the Cordeliers was
of real importance. During all Lafayette’s attempt to
centralise the militia of Paris this battalion had remained
independent; its attitude during the days of October, its
defence of Marat in January, had proved this. The crisis
appeared to demand from this revolutionary body a strong
protest against the use of the militia as an army to be
aimed against the people. Such a protest might have been
the cause of an outbreak in Paris. Under these circumstances
Danton—by what arguments we cannot tell (for
the whole affair is only known to us by a few lines of
Desmoulins)—obtained from his battalion a carefully-worded
pronouncement. “For all the high opinion we
have of the National Guards who took part in the affair<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_127"></a>[127]</span>
of Nancy, we can express no other sentiment than regret
for what has happened.”<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">[76]</a> It was moderate to the degree
of the common-place, but it saved Danton from the abyss
and from the street.</p>

<p>There followed another check in which he showed
once more his power of self-control. The “Notables”—corresponding
something to the aldermen of our new
municipal scheme in England—were to be elected for
Paris a little after the elections for the mayor and for the
governor of the Commune. Each Section was to elect
three, and Danton had so far regained his influence at
home as to be elected for the Théâtre Français.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the new constitution of Paris had been
provided with one of those checks whose main object it
is to interfere with direct representation. The choice of
each Section was submitted to the censure or the approval
of all the others. It is by the judgment which they
pass that we can best judge the suspicion in which he
was held by the great bulk of his equals. A regular
campaign was led against him. The affair of Marat was
dragged up, especially the warrant for Danton’s arrest
which the Châtelet had issued six months before. That
very favourite device in electioneering, the doubt as to
real candidature, was used. The voter, not over-well
informed in a detail of law (especially at a time when all
law was being re-modelled), was told that the warrant
made Danton’s candidature illegal. They said he was
sold to Orleans, because he had haunted the Palais
Royal and because he hated Lafayette. The character
of demagogue—the one thing he desired to avoid—was
pinned to his coat, and alone of all the Notables he was
rejected by forty-three Sections (five only voting for him)
in the week between the 9th and the 16th of September.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">[77]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_128"></a>[128]</span></p>

<p>In these five were the Postes, Invalides, Luxembourg.
It was not the purely popular quarters that supported
Danton, but rather the University and the lawyers.</p>

<p>He took his defeat as a signal for still greater reserve,
letting his name take perspective, and refusing by any
act or phrase to obscure his reputation with new issues.
The tactics succeeded. When, in October, a public orator
was needed, they remembered him, and he presents the
deputation of the 10th of November. The circumstances
were as follows:—</p>

<p>The ministry which surrounded the King was frankly
reactionary. I do not mean that it was opposed to the
constitution of the moment. Perhaps the majority (and
the less important) of its members would have been loath
to bring back anything approaching the old regime. But
there were in the Revolution not only the facts but the
tendencies, and in a period when every day brought its
change, the tendencies were watched with an extreme
care. France may have thought, seeing the federation
on the Champ de Mars and the altar where Talleyrand
had said mass, that the Revolution was at an end and
the new state of affairs established in peace, but those
in the capital knew better; and the men immediately
surrounding the King, who saw the necessary consequences
of his signing the civic constitution, and the growing
breach between himself and the assembly—these men
were on the King’s side. The affair at Nancy, which had
aroused so many passions, was the thing which finally
roused Parisian opinion; and at the very moment when
the King is secretly planning the flight to Montmédy—that
flight which six months later failed—Paris is for
the first time claiming to govern the councils of the
kingdom.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_129"></a>[129]</span></p>

<p>It was the Sections that began the movement, those
Sections whose action was to have been so restricted, and
which, upon the contrary, were becoming the permanent
organs of expression in the capital.</p>

<p>The Section Mauconseil on the 22nd of October sent
in a petition for the dismissal of the cabinet and appealed
to the National Assembly. The Section of the National
Library followed suit three days later, and sent its petition
not only to the Assembly but to the King. It must be
remembered that the legend of a good king deceived by
his advisers held at the time. Indeed, it survived the
flight to Varennes; it partly survived the 10th of August,
and only the research of recent times has proved clearly
the continual intrigue of which the King was the head.</p>

<p>On the 27th Mauconseil came forward again with a
petition to the mayor, Bailly, to call the general council
of the Commune and consider the complaints. Fourteen
other Sections backed this petition. Bailly hesitated, and
while he temporised, all the forty-eight Sections named
commissioners and sent them to an informal gathering
at the Archbishopric.<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">[78]</a></p>

<p>Danton was a member of this big committee and was
made secretary. He drew up an address; the mayor was
twice summoned to call the general council of the Commune.
Hesitating and afraid, Bailly finally did so, and
after a violent debate the resolution passed. Bailly was
sent by the town to “present the Commune at the bar
of the Assembly and demand the recall” of the Ministers
of Justice, War, and the Interior—De Cicé, La Tour du
Pin, and St. Priest.</p>

<p>Danton was taken out of the informal body to which
he had acted as secretary, and asked to be the orator<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"></a>[130]</span>
of the legal Commune. There followed on the 10th of
November a very curious scene.</p>

<p>Bailly pitifully apologising with his eyes brought in
the representative body of Paris. It was present for the
first time in the National Parliament, and before three
years were over Paris was to be the mistress of the Parliament.
At present they were out of place; their demand
frightened them. It needed Danton’s voice to reassure
them and to bring the opposing forces to a battle.</p>

<p>His voice, big, rough, and deep, perhaps with a
slight provincial accent, helped to strengthen the false
idea that the gentlemen of the Parliament had formed.
This Danton, of whom they heard so much, had appeared
suddenly out of his right place—for he had no official
position—and the Right was furious.</p>

<p>Yet Danton’s harangue was moderate and sensible.
There is, indeed, one passage on the position of Paris
in France which is interesting because it is original, but
the bulk of the speech is a string of plain arguments.
This passage is as follows:—</p>

<p>“That Commune, composed of citizens who belong in a
fashion to the eighty-three Departments—(<i>The Right</i>, No!
no!)—jealously desiring to fulfil in the name of all good
citizens the duties of a sentinel to the constitution, is
in haste to express a demand which is dear to all the
enemies of tyranny—a demand which would be heard
from all the Sections of the Empire, could they be
united with the same promptitude as the Sections of
Paris.”<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">[79]</a></p>

<p>For the rest, he is continually insisting upon the right
of the Parliament to govern—the right, above all, of a
representative body to dismiss a ministry. He had in
this, as in certain other matters, a very English point of
view, and certainly the arguments he used were able.
But he was interrupted continually, and we get, even in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_131"></a>[131]</span>
the dry account of the <i>Moniteur</i>, a good picture of what
the scene must have been like—</p>

<p>“A dismissal which the Assembly has the right to
demand.”</p>

<p>The Abbé Maury: “Who ever said that?” [Murmurs
and discussion followed. The Abbé was called to order,
when....]</p>

<p>M. Cazales remarked: “It is our duty to listen, even
if they talk nonsense.”</p>

<p>Danton began again with: “The Commune of Paris
is better able to judge the conduct of ministers than....”</p>

<p>The Abbé Maury: “Why?” [He is again called to
order.]</p>

<p>And so it went on. But in a duel of this kind lungs
are the weapons, and Danton had the best lungs in the
hall. He had also perhaps the soundest brain of any;
but the Abbé Maury and his friends had chosen more
rapid methods than those of arguments. The short
address ended (it did not take a quarter of an hour to
read), and the deputation left the Assembly. This last
debated and refused the decree; yet the Commune had
succeeded, for in a few days the Archbishop of Bordeaux
left the Ministry of Justice, and La Tour du Pin, “who
thought that parchment alone made nobility” (a phrase
of Danton’s which had upset the Right), left the Ministry
of War.</p>

<p>The deputation had petitioned on Wednesday, the
10th of November. Four days later he was elected head
of the militia battalion in which he had served for a
year.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> There is some doubt as to whether he remained
long at this post. Some antagonists talk vaguely of his
“leading his battalion” in ’92, but never as eye-witnesses.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132"></a>[132]</span>
On the other hand, there is a letter in existence talking
of Danton’s resignation; but it is unsigned and undated.
Only some one has written in pencil, “Gouvion, 22nd
November.”<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">[81]</a></p>

<p>At any rate, the interest of the little incident lies in
the fact that it meant a meeting between Danton and
Lafayette, and, as Freron remarks in his journal, “Cela
serait curieux.”<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> Perhaps they did not meet.</p>

<p>The campaign continually directed against Danton
was as active in this matter as in all others. It gives
one, for instance, an insight into the management and discipline
of the guards to learn that “Coutra, a corporal,
went about asking for signatures against Danton’s nomination.”<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">[83]</a>
He had just risen above the successes of his
enemies. November had put him on a sure footing again,
and in January he reached the place he had had so long
in view, the administration of Paris.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the voting was by two
degrees. The electors nominated an “electoral college,”
who elected the Commune and its officers. Already in
October Danton had been put into the electoral college
by twenty-six members chosen by his Section, but not
without violent opposition. Finally, after eight ballots,
on the 31st of January 1791, he became a member of
the administration of the town—the twenty-second on
a list of thirty-six elected. He failed, however, in his
attempt to be chosen “Procureur,” and through all the
year 1791 he keeps his place in the administration of
Paris merely as a stepping-stone. He does not speak
much in the Council. He used his partial success only
for the purpose of attaining a definite position from which
he could exercise some measure of executive control; this
position he finally attains (as we shall see) in the following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133"></a>[133]</span>
December, and it is from it that he is able to direct
the movement of 1792.</p>

<p>The year 1791 does not form a unit in the story
of the Revolution. It is cut sharply in two by the flight
of the King in June. Before that event things went with
a certain quietude. The tendency to reaction and the
tendency to extreme democracy are to be discovered, but
there can be no doubt that a kind of lassitude has taken
the public mind. After all, the benefits of the Revolution
are there. The two years of discussion, the useless acrimony
of the preceding autumn, began to weary the voters—there
is a sentiment of joviality abroad.</p>

<p>After the flight of the King all is changed. To a
period of development there succeeds a period of violent
advance, and of retreat yet more violent; there appears
in France the first mention of the word republic, and all
the characters that hung round Lafayette come definitely
into conflict with the mass of the people. The action of
the troops on the Champ de Mars opens the first of those
impassable gulfs between the parties, and from that
moment onward there arise the hatreds that are only
satisfied by the death of political opponents.</p>

<p>In that first period, then, which the death of Mirabeau
was to disturb, the 18th of April to endanger, and the
flight of the King to close, Danton’s rôle, like that of all
the democrats, is effaced. Why should it not be? The
violent discussions that followed the affair of Nancy led,
as it were, to a double satisfaction: the loyal party saw
that after all the Radicals were not destroying the State;
the Radicals, on the other hand, had learnt that the
loyalists could do nothing distinctly injurious to the
nation without being discovered. At least, they thought
they had learnt this truth. They did not know how for
months Mirabeau had been in the pay of the Court, and
how the executive power had concerned itself with the
King rather than with the nation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"></a>[134]</span></p>

<p>A sign of this appeasement in the violence of the
time (a movement, by the way, which was exactly what
Danton desired) is his letter to La Rochefoucald, the
president of the Department, when the successful election,
which I have described above, was known. This letter,
one of the very few which Danton has left, is a singularly
able composition. He alludes to the mistrust which had
been felt when his name was mentioned; he does not deny
the insurrectionary character of the quarter of Paris which
he inspired. But he replies: “I will let my actions,
now that I hold public office, prove my attitude, and if
I am in a position of responsibility, it will have a special
value in showing that I was right to continually claim
the public control of administrative functions.” The
whole of the long letter<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> is very well put; it is Danton
himself that speaks, and it is hard to doubt that at this
moment he also was one of those who thought they were
touching the end of the reform, that goal which always
fled from the men who most sincerely sought it.</p>

<p>He did not, however, come often to the Council—to
less than a quarter of its sittings, at the most; moreover,
the men who composed it still looked upon him with
suspicion; and when, on the 4th of May, the committees
were drawn up, his name was omitted. He asked on the
next day to be inscribed on the committee that contained
Sieyès, and his request was granted.</p>

<p>The activity of Danton during these few months was
not even shown at the Cordeliers; though that club occasionally
heard him, it was at the Jacobins that he principally
spoke.</p>

<p>This famous club, on which the root of the Revolution
so largely depends, was at this period by no means the
extreme and Robespierrian thing with which we usually
associate the name. It hardly even called itself “the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135"></a>[135]</span>
Jacobins” yet, but clung rather to its original name of
“Friends of the Constitution.” Its origin dated from the
little gathering of Breton deputies who were in the habit,
while the Assembly was still at Versailles, of meeting
together to discuss a common plan of action. When
the Assembly came to Paris, this society, in which by
that time a very large number of deputies had enrolled
themselves, took up their place in the hall of the
Dominicans or “Jacobins,” just off the Rue St. Honoré.
(Its site is just to the east of the square of Vendôme to-day.)
It was a union of all those who desired reform,
and in the first part of the year 1790 it had been
remarkable for giving a common ground where the
moderate and extremist, all who desired reform, could
meet. The Duc de Broglie figures among its presidents.
It was the Royalists, the extreme Court party, that dubbed
these “Friends of the Constitution” “Jacobins,” and it
was not till somewhat later that they themselves adopted
and gloried in the nickname. It was composed not only
of deputies, but of all the best-born and best-bred of the
Parisian reformers, drawn almost entirely from the noble
or professional classes, and holding dignified sessions, to
which the public were not admitted.</p>

<p>Almost at the same moment, namely, towards the
autumn and winter of 1790, two features appeared in it.
First, the Moderates begin to leave it, and the schism
which finally produced the “Feuillants” is formed;
secondly, there come in from all over France demands
from the local popular societies to be affiliated to the
great club in Paris. These demands were granted.
There arises a kind of “Jacobin order,” which penetrates
even to the little country towns, everywhere preaches
the same doctrine, everywhere makes it its business to
keep a watch against reaction. These local clubs depended
with a kind of superstition upon the decrees of
what, without too violent a metaphor, we may call<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136"></a>[136]</span>
the “Mother House” in Paris; it was this organisation
that aroused the apathy of provincial France and trained
the new voters in political discussion, and it was this also
that was later captured by Robespierre, who, like a kind
of high priest, directed a disciplined body wherever the
affiliated societies existed.</p>

<p>Danton first joined the society at the very moment
when this double change was in progress, in September
1790. His energies, which were employed in the club to
arrange the difficulty with the Moderates (if that were
possible), were also used (to quote a well-known phrase)
in “letting France hear Paris.” The Cordeliers had been
essentially Parisian; steeped in that feeling, Danton spoke
from the Rue St. Honoré to the whole nation.</p>

<p>It is with the end of March that he begins to be heard,
in a speech attacking Collot d’Herbois; for that unpleasant
fellow was then a Moderate. It is apropos of
that speech that the “Sabbots Jacobites” give us the
satirical rhyme on Danton, which recalls his face when he
spoke, looking all the uglier for the energy which he put
into his words:—</p>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>On the 3rd of April it was known in Paris that
Mirabeau was dead. He had been killed with the overwork
of attempting to save the King from himself. A
masterly intrigue, a double dealing which was hidden
for a generation, had exhausted him, and in the terrible
strain of balancing such opposite interests as those of
France, which he adored, and Louis, whom he served,
his two years of struggle suddenly fell upon him and
crushed him. He smiled at the sun and called it God’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_137"></a>[137]</span>
cousin, boasted like a genius, gave a despairing phrase to
the monarchy, demanded sleep, and died.</p>

<p>Danton had always, from a long way off, understood
his brother in silk and with the sword. On this day
he passionately deplored the loss. Like all Paris, the
Jacobins forgot Mirabeau’s treason, and remembered his
services when the news of his sudden death fell upon
them. From their tribune Danton spoke in terms in which
he almost alone foretold the coming reaction, and he was
right. The King, hardly restrained from folly by the
compromise of the great statesman, plunged into it when
his support was withdrawn. He had been half Mirabeau’s
man, now he was all Antoinette’s.</p>

<p>It was the fatal question of religion that precipitated
the crisis. Louis could not honestly receive the Easter
communion from a constitutional priest. On the other
hand, he might have received it quietly in his household.
He chose to make it a public ceremony, and to go in
state to St. Cloud for his Easter duties. It was upon
April 18th, a day or two more than a fortnight after
Mirabeau’s death, that he would have set out. As one
might have expected, the streets filled at once. The
many battalions of the National Guard who were on the
democratic side helped the people to stop the carriage;
in their eyes, as in that of the populace, the King’s journey
to St. Cloud was only part of the scheme to leave Paris
to raise an army against the Assembly.<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">[86]</a></p>

<p>On the other hand, those of the National Guard who
obeyed Lafayette<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> could not, by that very fact, move
until Lafayette ordered them. Thus the carriage was
held for hours, until at last, in despair, the King went
back to the Tuilleries.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, what had occurred at the Hotel de Ville?<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_138"></a>[138]</span>
The testimony is contradictory and the whole story
confused, but the truth seems to have been something
of this kind. Lafayette certainly called on the administration
of the Department and asked for martial law. Bailly
as certainly was willing to grant it. Danton was called from
his rank and came to oppose it; but did he end the
matter by his speech? Camille Desmoulins<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> says so,
and draws a fine picture of Danton carrying the administration
with him, as he carried the club or the street.
But Desmoulins is often inaccurate, and here his account
is improbable. Danton’s own note of the circumstance
(which he thought worthy of being pinned to his family
papers) runs: “I was present at the Department when
MM. the commandant and the mayor demanded martial
law.” Nothing more.</p>

<p>Desmoulins makes another mistake when he attributes
to Danton the letter which was written to the King,
and which was sent on the night of the 18th; it reproached
him for his action, sharply criticised his
rejection of constitutional priests. It was not Danton,
it was Talleyrand (a member also of the Department)
who wrote this letter.</p>

<p>It is probable that Danton and Talleyrand knew each
other. Talleyrand was a good judge of men, and would
have many strings to his bow—we know that he
depended upon Danton’s kindness at a critical moment
in 1792—but the style of the letter is not Danton’s, and
the document as we find it in Schmidt is definitely
ascribed to Talleyrand.</p>

<p>This is all we can gather as to his place in the
popular uprising to prevent the King’s leaving Paris. A
placard of some violence issued from the Cordeliers, saying
that he had “forbidden Lafayette to fire on the people;”
but Danton disowned it in a meeting of the Department.</p>

<p>This much alone is certain, that the 18th of April<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139"></a>[139]</span>
had finally put Danton and Lafayette face to face, and
that in the common knowledge of Paris they would be
the heads of opposing forces in the next crisis. But their
rôles turned out to be the very opposite of what men
would have predicted. It was Lafayette who shot and
blustered, and had his brief moment of power; it was
Danton who made a flank movement and achieved a
final victory. For the next crisis was the flight of
the King.</p>

<p>It would be irrelevant to give the story of this flight
in the life of Danton. Our business is to understand
Danton by following the exact course of his actions
during June and July, and by describing exactly the
nature of the movement in which his attitude took the
form which we are investigating.</p>

<p>Two things command the attention when we study
the France of 1791. France was monarchic and France
was afraid. History knows what was to follow; the men
of the time did not. There lay in their minds the
centuries of history that had been; their future was to
them out of conception, and as unreal as our future is
to us. You may notice from the very first moment of
the true Revolution a passion for the King. For most
he is a father, but for all a necessary man. They took
him back to Paris; they forced him to declarations of
loyalty, and then, with the folly of desire, accepted as
real an emotion which they had actually dictated. Such
was the movement of the 4th of February 1790; such
the sentiment of the Federation in July of that year.
And the people understood his reluctance in taking communion
from a nonjuring priest, however much the upper
class might be astonished. What no one understood
was that only Mirabeau stood between the Crown and
its vilest temptations; only his balance of genius, his
great and admirable fault of compromise, prevented Louis
from yielding to his least kingly part, and while he lived<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140"></a>[140]</span>
the king of the French preferred the nation to his own
person. But Mirabeau was dead. They did well to
mourn him, those who had smelt out his treason and
guessed the weakness of the artist in him; they did well
to forgive him; his head misunderstood France, but his
broad French shoulders had supported her. The 18th
of April was a direct consequence of his death; the
21st of June was a fall through a broken bridge: Louis
had yielded to himself.</p>

<p>Well, France was also afraid. This democracy (as it
had come to be), an experiment based upon a vision,
knew how perilous was the path between the old and
the new ideals. She feared the divine sunstroke that
threatens the road to Damascus. In that passage, which
was bounded on either side by an abyss, her feet went
slowly, one before the other, and she looked backward
continually. In the twisting tides at night her one
anchor to the old time was the monarchy. Thus when
Louis fled the feeling was of a prop broken. France
only cried out for one thing—“Bring the King back.”
Tie up the beam—a makeshift—anything rather than a
new foundation.</p>

<p>Here is the attitude of Danton in this crisis. France
is not republican; his friends in Paris are. He inclines
to France. It was Danton more than any other one
man who finally prepared the Republic, yet the Republic
was never with him an idea. The consequences of the
Republic were his goal; as for the systems, systems were
not part of his mind. At the close of this chapter we
shall see him overthrowing the Crown; he did it because
he thought it the one act that could save France; but
the Crown as an idea he never hated: he lived in existing
things.</p>

<p>These were the reasons that made him hesitate at
this date. A man understanding Europe, he saw that
the governments were not ready to move; a man understanding<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141"></a>[141]</span>
his own country, he saw that it would have the
King in his place again; a man, on the other hand, who
had met and appreciated the idealists, he saw that the
Republic already existed in the mind; and a man who
understood the character of his fellows better than did
any contemporary, he saw that the men who were bound
to lead were inclined to a declaration against the King.
He suffered more than his action should have warranted,
and he goes through a sharp few days of danger on
account of association and of friends in spite of all his
caution.</p>

<p>When Louis was known to have fled, and when Paris,
vigilant beyond the provinces, and deceived by the declaration
of April, had undergone its first wave of passion,
the word Republic began to be spoken out loud. The
theorists found themselves for once in accordance with
public humour; and against the keenness, if not the
numbers, of those who petitioned for the deposition of
the King on his return, there stood two barriers—the
Assembly and the moderate fortunes of the capital.
Danton lived with the former, thought with the latter,
and was all but silent.</p>

<p>The bust of Louis XIV. before the Hotel de Ville was
broken; men climbed on ladders to chisel off the lilies
from the palaces, and there soon appears a new portent:
some one cries out, “Only a Republic can defend itself at
the last.”</p>

<p>To this somewhat confused cry for a Republic came
the very sharp announcement from no less a person than
Condorcet. Condorcet, the moderate and illumined, was
also half a visionary, and there had always floated in his
mind the system of contract by which England had
excused the movement of 1688, but which France took
seriously. England had for him the attraction which it
had for all the professionals of that date—an attraction
which lasted till the disasters of 1870, and which you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_142"></a>[142]</span>
may yet discover here and there among those who are
the heirs of Lamartine. England had given them Locke,
and Condorcet’s reasoning on the King’s flight<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> reads like
a passage from the Bill of Rights. Yet he was a good
and sincere man, and died through simplicity of heart.</p>

<p>On the 4th of July, ten days or more after the King
had been brought back to Paris,<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> it was Condorcet who
made the demand for the Republic; in a speech at
Fauchet’s club he asked for a National Convention to
settle the whole matter. He wrote so in the papers<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">[91]</a>
all through July, and even after the affair of the Champ
de Mars he continued his agitation.</p>

<p>Now how do we know Danton’s attitude? The
Cordeliers presented a petition of June 21st itself and
demanded the Republic. It is largely from this document
that the error has arisen. But Danton was not then
with the Cordeliers; his name does not appear. It is at
the Jacobins that he is heard, and the Jacobins took up
a distinctly monarchical position. They all rose in a
body on the 22nd and passed a unanimous vote in favour
of the constitution and the King.<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> Danton was present
when this vote was passed, and he had just heard the
hissing of the Cordeliers’ petition; he was silent. Thomas
Payne is demanding the Republic in the <i>Moniteur</i>;
Sieyès replies for the monarchy;<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">[93]</a>, even Robespierre
tardily speaks in favour of ideas and against change of
etiquette; Marat shouts for a dictator;<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">[94]</a> Danton, almost
alone, refuses to be certain. On June 23rd he spoke at
the Jacobins in favour of a council to be elected by the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_143"></a>[143]</span>
Departments immediately, but he proposed nothing as to
its actions; it was merely his permanent idea of a central,
strong power.</p>

<p>Lafayette amused himself by arresting people who
repeated this in the street, but Lafayette hated Danton
blindly. Nothing republican can be made of a speech
which his enemies said was “a loophole for Orleans.”</p>

<p>Danton attacked Lafayette: he saw persons more
clearly than ideas, and Lafayette was Danton’s nightmare.
He was that being which of all on earth Danton
thought most dangerous, the epitome of all the faults
which he attacked to the day of his death; in Louis, in
Robespierre, “The weak man in power.” He drove him
out of the Jacobins on the 21st, and later in the day
gave the cry against his enemy in the street, which the
fears of the Assembly so much exaggerated.</p>

<p>For the events of the twenty-four hours had all
added to his natural opposition to Lafayette, and as we
relate them from Danton’s standpoint, we shall see this
much of truth in the idea that he led the movement,
namely, that the three days of the King’s flight and
recapture, while they put Lafayette into a position of
great power, made also Danton his antagonist, the leader
of the protest against the general’s methods. It is the
more worthy of remark that in such conditions the word
“Republic” never crossed his lips.</p>

<p>At eleven o’clock at night on the Monday of the
King’s flight, Danton and Desmoulins were coming home
alone from the Jacobins. Each remarked to the other
the emptiness of the streets and the lack of patrols, and
at that moment, when the evasion was little suspected,
each was in a vague doubt that Lafayette had some
reason for concentrating the National Guard.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Desmoulins
will even have it that he saw him enter the palace, as
the two friends passed the Tuilleries.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_144"></a>[144]</span></p>

<p>The next morning at the Cordeliers Danton cried out
against Lafayette for a moment, and then at the Jacobins
he made the speech that has been mentioned above. Continually
he attacks the man who was preparing a counter-revolution,
but I do not believe he would have attached
the least importance at that moment to a change in
the etiquette of government. Thus, as the Department
was sent for by the Assembly in the afternoon, Danton
came later than his colleagues, provided himself with
a guard, and as he crossed the Tuilleries gardens he
harangued the people, but against Lafayette, not against
the King.</p>

<p>Now, to make sure of this feature, the duel between
Lafayette and Danton, and to see that it is the principal
thing at the time, turn once more to the scene at the
Jacobins, and compare it with Lafayette’s Memoirs, and
you will find that Danton was the terror of the saviour
of two worlds, and that it was upon Lafayette that Danton
had massed his artillery.</p>

<p>Here is Danton at the Jacobins, sitting by Desmoulin’s
side; he goes to the tribune and speaks upon the
disgrace and danger that the Moderates have brought
about. When Lafayette entered during the speech, he
turned upon him suddenly, and launched one of those
direct phrases which made him later the leader of the
Convention: “I am going to talk as though I were at
the bar of God’s justice, and I will say before you, M.
Lafayette, what I would say in the presence of Him who
reads all hearts.... How was it that you, who pretend
to know nothing of me, tried to corrupt me to your views
of treason?... How was it that you arrested those who
in last February demanded the destruction of Vincennes?
You are present; try to give a clear reason.... How
was it that the very same men were on guard when the
King tried to go to St. Cloud on the 18th of April were
on guard last night when the King fled?... I will not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_145"></a>[145]</span>
mention the 6000 men<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">[96]</a> whom you have picked as a
garrison for the King; only answer clearly these three
accusations. For in their light you, who answered with
your head that the King should not fly, are either a
traitor or a fool. For either you have permitted him to
fly, or else you undertook a responsibility which you could
not fulfil: in the best case, you are not capable of commanding
the guard.... I will leave the tribune, for I
have said enough.”<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">[97]</a></p>

<p>This is clear enough in all conscience to show what
was Danton’s main pre-occupation in the days of June
1791. And if, upon the other hand, you will turn to
Lafayette’s Memoirs, the third volume, the 83rd and
following pages, you will find that Danton was Lafayette’s
pre-occupation, and that he makes this moment the
occasion to deliver the most definite and (luckily) the
most demonstrably false of his many accusations of venality.
He tells us that he could not reply because it
would have “cost Montmorin his life;” that Montmorin
“had the receipt for the 100,000 francs;” that Danton
had been “reimbursed to the extent of 100,000 francs
for a place worth 10,000,” and so forth. We know now
exactly the amount of compensation paid to him and his
colleagues at the court of appeal,<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> and we know that
Lafayette, writing a generation later, animated by a bitter
hatred, and remembering that somebody had paid Danton
something, and with his head full of vague rumours of
bribing, has fallen into one of those unpardonable errors
common to vain and vacillating men. But at this juncture<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146"></a>[146]</span>
the main point that should be seized is that Danton
was taking the opportunity of the King’s evasion to attack
Lafayette with all his might, and that a generation later
the old man chiefly remembered Danton as leading the
popular anger which the commander of the guard thought
himself bound to repress. It is this that will explain
why Danton, who so carefully avoided giving the word
for the Republican “false start,” was yet marked out,
fled, and returned to lead the opposition.</p>

<p>The Cordeliers followed Danton’s lead. They got up
a petition,<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> signed by 30,000 in Paris, demanding that
the affair should be laid before the country, but not demanding
the abolition of the monarchy. Memdar, their
president, declared himself a monarchist. But the petition,
though read at the Assembly, was not adopted, and,
on the 9th of July, the Cordeliers presented another.
Charles de Lameth (who was president that fortnight)
refused to read it. The Assembly, in other words, was
dumb; it was determined (like its successor a year later)
to do nothing—an attitude which (for all it knew) might
be very wise, and those who were following Danton determined
upon a definite policy. On Friday the 15th, at
the Jacobins, it was determined to draw up a petition
which begged that the Assembly should <i>first</i> recognise
Louis as having abdicated by his flight, unless the nation
voted his reinstatement, and <i>secondly</i> (in case the nation
did not do so), take measures to have him constitutionally
replaced. Now the constitution was monarchist.</p>

<p>The petition was to be taken to be read at the Champ
de Mars on the altar, and there to obtain signatures. It
was drawn up by Danton, Sergent, Lanthanas, Ducanel,
and Brissot, who wrote it out and worded most of it.
The events that follow must be noted with some care,
because on their exact sequence depends our judgment
of Lafayette’s action and of Danton’s politics.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_147"></a>[147]</span></p>

<p>On Saturday<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">[100]</a> the 16th, about mid-day, a deputation
of four from the Jacobins came to the Champ de Mars.
The petition was read by a little light-haired Englishman
on one side, and by a red-haired Frenchman in a red
coat on the other; picturesque but unimportant details.
Danton leapt on to the corner of the altar, and read it
again to the thick of the crowd. The signatures were
written in great numbers, and when the completed document
was about to start for the Assembly, when the deputation
that was to take it was already formed, it was
suddenly spread abroad that the Assembly had passed a
vote exonerating Louis.</p>

<p>The Jacobins were appealed to, and replied that under
the conditions the petition which they had drawn up
could not be presented. The Cordeliers, however, lost
their tempers, and Robert determined to draw up a new
petition. Now in this second action Danton took no
part. It was this new petition that (signed by Robert,
Peyre, Vachard, and Demoy) was drawn up hastily in the
Champ de Mars on Sunday the 17th, to this that the
6000 signatures were attached, and this which demanded
a “Convention to judge the King.” There followed the
proclamation of martial law, the appearance of Lafayette
and Bailly in the Champ de Mars with the red flag, the
conflict between the National Guard and the crowd, and
all that is called the “Massacre of the Champ de
Mars.”</p>

<p>That petition was not signed by Danton.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> He was
not even present,<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> as we know from his speech on his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148"></a>[148]</span>
election to be “Substitut-Procureur,” and especially from
the fact that in the fortnight of terror, when the red flag
stood over the Hotel de Ville, when the democrats were
arrested or in hiding, when the door of the Cordeliers
was shut and nailed, and when the Radical newspapers
were suppressed, no warrant of arrest could be issued,
because there existed nothing definite against him. Lafayette
was determined, however, to act in a military
fashion, and on the 4th of August the arrest of Danton
was ordered, on some other plea which he alludes to in
his speech of the next January, but the exact terms of
which have not come down to us.</p>

<p>He had left Paris at once when he saw that Lafayette
had practically absolute power for the moment. He first
went to his father-in-law’s, Charpentier, at Rosny-sur-Bois,
and then escaped to Arcis. Before the warrant was
actually made out, Lafayette had sent a man to watch
him at Arcis. He was “giving a dinner. It would need
a troop of cavalry to arrest him. Everybody was on his
side.”<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> Marseilles and Bar spoke up for him. But the
attack only grew stronger. On the 31st of July he
moved again to Troyes, to the house of Millaud, of his
father’s profession, and a friend, because he feared a new
arrival from Paris who seemed a spy.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">[104]</a> He was there
when the warrant was sent down to the “procureur” for
the arrest; the official in question was Beugnot, and
Beugnot told Danton jocularly that he would not arrest
him. He did not think this a sufficient guarantee, and
as his stepfather, Recordain, was off to England to buy
some machinery for a cotton-mill that he thought of
starting, Danton went to England with him, and remained
in this country for a month, staying in the house
of his stepfather’s sons, who were established in London.
It was in the last days of July or the first days in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_149"></a>[149]</span>
August<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">[105]</a> that he arrived, and he did not return to
Paris until the appointment of his friend Garran de
Coulon as President of the Court of Appeal. He appears
again at the Jacobins on the 12th of September; some
say he was in Paris on the 10th.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">[106]</a></p>

<p>It would be of the utmost interest to know how he
passed those thirty or forty days. Unfortunately there is
no direct evidence as to whom he met or what negotiations
he entered into. As to his English acquaintances,
his letters from Priestley and Christie, the relations he
had with Talleyrand, and their common diplomacy for the
English alliance—all these properly belong to Danton in
power, the minister directing France after August 1792, and
it is in that place that they will be dealt with. Of historical
events in his voyage we have none, and there is
no more regrettable gap in the very disconnected series
of ascertained facts concerning him.</p>

<p>On his return, he discovered that the Section of the
Théâtre Français had named him a member of the electoral
college which sat at the Archbishop’s palace. Many members
of this Assembly had been arrested, or had fled during
Lafayette’s violent efforts of reaction in August and September.
The new Parliament which had just met did not
decree an amnesty (as it was asked to do on the 5th of
September), but it was of course far more democratic than
the old Assembly, and it was understood to be tacitly in
favour of the return of those whom Lafayette had driven
out. Following Danton’s example, they slowly came back;
but a curious incident shows how much of the danger
remained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_150"></a>[150]</span></p>

<p>On the 13th of September the Parliament, at the
desire of the King, voted the amnesty. While it was
actually voting, a constable called Damien got into the
gallery of the hall in which Danton and the electors were
debating, and sent a note to the president asking him to
allow the arrest. The president and the electoral college
(who did not like Danton, by the way, and who would
not give him more than forty votes when it came to electing
members for Paris) yet ordered the arrest by Damien,
and it was only when they learnt of the amnesty that, on
Danton’s own motion, he was released.</p>

<p>It has just been said that Danton failed to be elected:
let us point out the conditions under which the Legislative
met, that short Parliament of one year which made
the war, and saw to its dismay the end of the monarchy.</p>

<p>The Legislative was not elected in one of those moments
of decision which were the formative points of the Revolution.
It came upon a very curious juncture, and showed
in all its first acts a marked indecision.</p>

<p>The members were chosen under the action of a
peculiar combination, or rather confusion of emotions.
The King had fled, had been recaptured. France, of many
possible evils, had chosen what she believed to be the
least when she reinstated him. “The New Pact” was
accepted even by those who had spoken of the Republic
in July. Condorcet, who had led the civic theorists
towards the Republic, leads them also now in this movement
of reconciliation. Again, these were the first elections
held since the middle class and the peasantry had
been given the suffrage over the heads of the artisans:
it was the most sober part of France that dictated the
policy of the moment. The divisions that the King’s
flight had laid bare, the sharp reaction and terror of the
Champ de Mars—all these were forgotten.</p>

<p>Thus the Parliament will not have Garran-Coulon for
its first president, and yet on the next day passes the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"></a>[151]</span>
extreme democratic etiquette as to the reception of the
King should he visit the Assembly. Next day it repeals
this, and when the King does visit the Assembly, he is met
by an outburst of loyalty and affection.</p>

<p>As to parties, the power lay, as it always does in a
French Assembly, with the centre—some three hundred
men, unimportant, of no fixed idea, unless indeed it were
to keep the Legislative to the work for which it had been
elected, that is, to keep it moving moderately on the lines
laid down for it by the constitution of 1791.</p>

<p>The right, well organised, loyal and brave, was Feuillant;
that is, it was monarchic and constitutional, but
more monarchic than constitutional. It was the support
of Lafayette, and on the whole the centre would vote with
it on any important occasion.</p>

<p>But there sat on the left a group less compact, full of
personal ambitions and personal creeds, containing almost
all the orators whose names were to make famous the
following year. It was but a group of 130 men, even if we
include all those who signed the register of the Jacobins
when the Assembly met; yet it was destined, ill-disciplined
as it was, part wild and part untrue, to lead all France.
Why? Because the King was to make impossible the
action of the Moderates, because his intrigue made Frenchmen
choose between him and France, and in the inevitable
war the men who were determined to realise the Revolution
could not but be made the leaders.</p>

<p>As has been said above, Danton was not elected.
The electoral college, of which he was a member, chose
Moderates for the most part, such as Pastoret and De
Quincy, and the narrow suffrage represented the true drift
of Parisian feeling only in the case of a few—De Séchelles,
Brissot, Condorcet, and a handful of others. But though
Danton did not sit in the Legislative he was free for action
in two other directions, which (as it turned out) were the
commanding positions in the great changes that came with<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_152"></a>[152]</span>
the war. He was free to attain an administrative position
in the municipality of Paris, and he was free to use his
power of oratory at the Jacobins.</p>

<p>As to the first, it came with his moderate but important
success in the municipal elections at the close of
the year. Bailly, frightened out of place, half-regretting
his action of the Champ de Mars, had resigned, and
Pétion, on November 16th, was elected in his place.
Only ten thousand voted, and he obtained 6700 votes.
On the same day the Procureur of the new Commune
was to be elected. A Procureur under the new system
was a position of the greatest importance. He was, so
to speak, the advocate of the town, its tribune in the
governing body, and with his two substitutes (who aided
and occasionally replaced him) was meant to form a kind
of small committee whose business was to watch the
interests and to define the attitude of the electorate
whenever those interests were in jeopardy or that attitude
was opposed to the policy of the elected body.
These three positions were dangerous, but would lead to
popularity, and perhaps to power, if they were directed
by a certain kind of ability. It was precisely such a
power, the quality of a tribune, that Danton knew himself
to possess.</p>

<p>His candidature for the principal position was cordially
supported by the Cordeliers, but the Jacobins were
divided, and they hesitated. Manuel was elected, and
Danton obtained only the third place. This vote, however,
was not decisive, and there was a second ballot on
December the 2nd. In this Manuel was definitely elected.</p>

<p>Cahier de Gerville (the second substitute) was made
Minister of the Interior, and Danton, on December 6th,<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">[107]</a>
was elected to his place by a majority of 500 over Collot
d’Herbois. It was from this position that he prepared
the 10th of August, and it was still as substitute that he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153"></a>[153]</span>
remained side by side with the insurrectionary commune,
and lending it something of legal sanction when the
King was overthrown.</p>

<p>Let me, before leaving this point, define exactly the
position in which his new dignity placed him. Three
men were charged with the advocacy of public opinion,
the Procureur and his two substitutes. Manuel, who was
elected to the principal position, was energetic, kindly,
and conscientious, but a man of no genius; he was good
to Madame De Staël in the days of September, as is
apparent from her rather contemptuous description of
how she appealed to him for safety; he did his very best
(with no power in his hands) to stop the massacres at that
same time. He was fond of work, and a little pompous
in his idea of office; he was, therefore, a man who would
only leave his substitutes the less important work to do,
and, from close by, would have been the dominating
member of the three. On the other hand, his lack of
decision and of initiative effaced him in moments of
danger or of new departures, and it is thus his second
substitute who seems to lead when seen from a distance,
from the point of view of the people, who only look
round when there is a noise.</p>

<p>The first substitute was Desmousseaux. He had
not resigned, and had therefore not been re-elected.
Forming part of the old Commune, and in office since
the winter of 1790, he was a Moderate by preference and
long tradition.</p>

<p>As for Danton himself, standing third in the group,
it was for him a position of honour and of dignity. That
part of him which was so capable of high office and so
desirous of an opportunity to act was well served by the
election. It seemed to put a term to the misconceptions
which his person, his faults, and the course of the
Revolution had created. But the great stream of events
moved him at their will. This office wherein he desired<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154"></a>[154]</span>
to appear settled at last, to show himself an administrator
rather than a leader of unreasoning men, was precisely
suited in case of danger to call out those other qualities
which had made him despised by many whom he himself
respected, and had aroused against him hatred—a passion
which he himself had never allowed to arise from anger.</p>

<p>If the spirit of 1791 had been kept, and if after so
many false promises the Revolution had been really
accomplished, then the official, or, if you will, the statesman,
would have appeared in him. I can see him in the
difficulties which even a settled kingdom would have had
to meet, convincing his contemporaries as he has convinced
posterity. He was the man to impress on others the
true attitude of Europe—the only diplomat among the
patriots. His disadvantages were of the kind that are
forgotten in the constant proof of ability; and his learning,
which was exactly of the kind to be used in the new
regime (a knowledge of languages, of law, of surrounding
nations, a combination of detail and of comprehension)—this
learning would have made necessary a man so popular
with the people to be ruled, and, in the matter of the
heart, so honestly devoted to his country. Had France,
I say, by some miracle been spared her Passion, and had
she been permitted to be happier and to do less for the
world, then as the new regime settled into the lower
reaches of quiet and content, I believe Danton would
have remained for us a name, perhaps less great, but
certainly among the first. England has been permitted.
She has been given good fortune, and no fate has asked
her to save civilisation with her blood, and therefore in
England we are accustomed to such careers; men whose
origin, whose exterior, and whose faults might have exiled
them, have yet been seen to rise from the municipal
to the imperial office, because they were possessed of
supreme abilities, and because they devoted those abilities
to the service of England. They have died in honour.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_155"></a>[155]</span></p>

<p>I will not discuss what it was that made the war.
There are no causes. Burke raved like a madman, but
then so did Marat. The King was alienated by the
clerical laws, but nothing is an excuse for treason. Pilnitz
was an affront and even a menace, but it was not a
declaration of war. There were peoples behind the kings,
as Mayence tragically proved; and if France fought intolerable
evils, she also seemed the iconoclast when she put
out the altar-lamp, which she is lighting again with her
own hand. There are no causes. Only, if you will look
and see how Europe has lived, and how our great things
have been done, you will find nothing but armies upon
armies marching past, and our history is an epic whose
beginning is lost, whose books are Roncesvalles and
Cortenuova and Waterloo, and whose end is never reached.
The war came, and with it a definite necessity to choose
between France and the Crown. In that crisis Danton is
thrown back upon insurrection. He, who desired men to
forget the days of October, was compelled to the 10th
of August because he was aroused. Even the massacres
were attached to his name, and there still trails after him
an easy flow of accusation, only a little less sordid or less
terrible.</p>

<p>To follow his action during the first months of 1772,
to hear his speeches on the war, and to note his policy,
we must leave him at his post in the Commune (where
we shall find him again when Paris rises in the summer),
and see how he stands for the Mountain at the Jacobins.</p>

<p>This club was now definitely the organ of the left. It
was after Danton had been elected, but before he was definitely
installed in office,<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> on the 14th of December, a week
after the former and five weeks before the latter event, that
the debate on the war was begun at the Jacobins,—a debate
of the first importance, because it opened the breach between
the Girondins and the Mountain, between the orators who<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_156"></a>[156]</span>
insisted on going to meet Europe, and even on a war of
propaganda, and the reformers who wished Europe to
take the first step, who dreaded war or who thought a
war of aggression immoral. At the head of these last
was Robespierre. But it is not too much to say that in
the first months of the year Danton was more important
at the Jacobins than Robespierre. What was his attitude?
It was part of the general policy upon which he had
determined: he compromised. In his first motion on the
14th of December, he attacked the idea of declaring war.
On the 16th he still attacked it, but in other terms. “I
know it must come. If any one were to ask me, ‘Are
we to have war?’ I would reply (not in argument, but
as a matter of fact), ‘We shall hear the bugles,’” But
the whole speech is taken up with an argument upon its
dangers, and especially upon “those who desire war in
the hope of reaction, who talk of giving us a constitution
like that of England, in the hope of giving us, later, one
like that of Turkey.”</p>

<p>In March and April, the months when the war was
preparing and was declared, he was silent. And we can
understand his silence when we turn to his speech in the
Commune when he was given office. He alludes to the
false character given him; he speaks of the reputation
which his past actions in Paris had given; he says things
that indicate a determination to play the part of a
Moderate, and to see whether in his case, as in that of so
many others, there would not be permanence in the compromise
of the last six months. But there rankled in his
mind the insults of the men with whom he sat, Condorcet’s
disavowal in his paper of so much as knowing
Danton, and he made a peroration which at the time
offended, but which possesses for us a certain pathos.
“Nature gave me a strong frame, and she put into my face
the violence of liberty. I have not sprung from a family
which was weakened by the protection of the old privileges;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157"></a>[157]</span>
my existence has been all my own; I know that I have
kept and shown my vigour, but in my profession and in
my private life I have controlled it. If I was carried
away by enthusiasm in the first days of our regeneration,
have I not atoned for it? Have I not been ostracised?...
I have given myself altogether to the people, and
now that they are beyond attack, now that they are in
arms and ready to break the league unless it consents to
dissolve,<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> I will die in their cause if I must, ... for I
love them only, and they deserve it. Their courage will
make them eternal.”</p>

<p>This outburst is the one occasion of his public life in
which Danton spoke of himself, and it has the ring of
genuine emotion; for in all his harangues he preserved,
both before and after this, an objective attitude, if anything
too much bent upon the outward circumstances.</p>

<p>Thus, when the notes came to go between the Austrian
and the French governments, he was silent. He fears that
France is unprepared; he fears that the King is betraying
the nation. How much he was a traitor was
not known till a far later period; but when at least
it is proved that something is undermining the French
people, that, apart from the defeats and the lack of
preparation, there is treason, then he leaves his silence.
The policy of the Moderate acting in a settled state is no
longer possible to any one; the court and the nation stood
one against the other, and one side or the other must be
taken by every man. Then he put off the conventions
which he respected, and which he regretted to the end;
he went back into the street; he headed the insurrection,
destroyed the monarchy; for twelve months he took upon
himself all the responsibility of errors in his own policy,
and of crime in that of his associates. He saved France,
but at this expense, that he went out of the world with a
reputation which he knew to be false, that he saw his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_158"></a>[158]</span>
great powers vulgarised, and that he could never possess,
either in his own mind or before the world, not even in
France, his true name. The whole of this tragedy is to
be found in his trial, and here and there in the few
phrases that escape him in the speeches or with his
friends. If you sum it up, it comes to this paraphrase of
a great sentence: <i>Son nom était flétri mais la France était
libre</i>.</p>

<p>It was upon April the 18th that the new Girondin
ministry received the note from Vienna rejecting the
French proposals of a month before. The poor King,
who had been protesting his loyalty to the nation in
Paris, had been protesting in Vienna the necessity of
sending an army to save him, and Austria gave this
reply. On April 20th the Assembly declared war with
practical unanimity<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">[110]</a> upon “the King of Hungary and of
Bohemia.” But the phrase was useless. You might as
well put a match into gunpowder and say, “It is the
sulphur I am after, not the charcoal.” Prussia joined,
and within a year we shall see all Europe at war with
France, in a war that outlawed and destroyed.</p>

<p>Danton was right. France was hopelessly unready.
She had not learnt the necessary truth that the soldier is
a man with a trade. The orators had mistaken words
for things; honest and great as they were, they had fallen
in this matter into the faults common to small and dishonest
verbiage. The rout and panic under De Dillon,
his murder by the troops, the occupation of Quiévrain,
came one upon the other. Paris was full of terror and
anger in proportion to the greatness of the things she
had done, which now seemed all destroyed. “We said
and did things that should have convinced the world;
we were to be a people unconquerable from our love
of liberty, and we appear a beaten, panic-stricken lot—volunteers
and babblers who cannot stand fire.”<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159"></a>[159]</span>
The King dismissed the Girondin ministers, even sent
Dumouriez away, heard Roland’s remonstrance, knew
that the Assembly was more and more against him; but
he remained calm. There was a plan of the simplest.
There was to be nothing but a few days of monotonous
marching between the allies and Paris. Lafayette with
his army of the centre was on his side. The Assembly
decreed a great camp of 20,000 men under Paris, and
the disbanding of the guard; the guard was disbanded,
but the King vetoed the decree. Lafayette wrote his
letter menacing the Parliament with his army; the reaction
seemed in full success and the invaders secure,
when Danton reappeared.</p>

<p>On the 18th of June he found the old phrases
against Lafayette at the Jacobins. “It is a great day
for France; Lafayette with only one face on is no longer
dangerous.” He did not make, but he permitted the
20th of June; and as Paris rose, and the immense mob,
grotesque, many-coloured, armed with all manner of
sharp things, passed before the Assembly and into the
Tuilleries, it might have been a signal or a warning.
The excited citizen makes a poor soldier, but if Paris
moves the whole great body of France stirs. Such giants
take long to be fully awake, and it is a matter of months
to drill men; still it is better to let great enemies sleep.
There was in that foolish, amiable crowd, with its pleasure
at the sight of the King, its comic idea of warning him,
something serious underlying. Danton will be using it
in a very short time; for there are points of attack where
mobs are like machine-guns—ridiculous in general warfare,
but very useful indeed in special conditions, and in
these conditions invincible. This something serious was
that vague force (you may call it only an idea) which you
will never find in an individual, and which you will
always discover in a mass—the great common man
which the French metaphysicians have called “Le<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_160"></a>[160]</span>
Peuple;” that, drilled, is called by the least metaphysical
an army.</p>

<p>A week later Lafayette appeared. He demanded the
right to use the army, and July opened with the certainty
of civil war.</p>

<p>July is the month of fevers; the heat has been
moving northward, and all France is caught in it. The
grapes fill out, and even in Picardy or in the Cotentin
you feel as though the Midi were giving her spirit to the
north. July made the Revolution and closed it. A
month that saw the Bastille fall and that buried Robespierre
is a very national time.</p>

<p>If you overlook France at this moment, you may see
the towns stirring as they had stirred three years before;
it is from them that the opposition rises—especially from
Marseilles. A crowd of young men dragging cannon, the
common-place sons of bourgeois, whom the time had
turned into something as great as peasants or as soldiers,
surged up the white deserts along the Rhone, passing
the great sheet of vineyards that slopes up the watershed
of Burgundy. As they came along they sang an excellent
new marching song. When they at last saw Paris,
especially the towers of Notre Dame from where they
just show above the city as you come in from Fontainebleau,
and as the roads came in together and the suburbs
thickened they sang it with louder voices. On the evening
of the 30th they came to the gates, and the workmen
of the south-eastern quarter began to sing it and called it
the “Marseillaise.” No one can describe music; but if
in a great space of time the actions of the French become
meaningless and the Revolution ceases to be an origin,
some one perhaps will recover this air, as we have
recovered a few stray notes of Greek music, and it will
carry men back to the Republic.</p>

<p>For ten days the insurrection grew. In a secret
committee which the Sections formed, men violent like<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161"></a>[161]</span>
Fournier, or good soldiers like Westermann, or local
leaders of quarters like Santerre—but all outside the
official body—organised the fighting force, and at their
head the one man who held the strings of the municipality—Danton.
The Assembly had heard Vergniaud’s
angry speech, but it had also confirmed the constitution
and the monarchy in the “baiser Lamourette.” Paris
had to work alone, and the King, seeing only Paris before
him, filled the Tuilleries, and stood by with a small
garrison to repress the mere movement of the city—“something
that should have been done in ’89.”</p>

<p>It was on a Paris thus enfevered, doubtful, nursing
a secret insurrectionary plan, but full of men who hesitated
and doubted, having still many who were loyal, that
there fell<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">[111]</a> the document which the King had asked of
his friends—but which he must, on seeing it, have regretted—the
manifesto of the commander of the allies. This
extraordinary monument of folly is rarely presented in
its entirety. It is only in such a form that its full
monstrosity can be appreciated, and I have therefore been
at pains to translate for my readers the rather halting
French in which Charles William proposed to arrest the
movements of Providence. It ran as follows<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">[112]</a>:—</p>

<p>“Their Majesties the Emperor and the King of Prussia
having given me the command of the armies assembled
on the French frontier, I have thought it well to tell
the inhabitants of that kingdom the motives that have
inspired the measures taken by the two sovereigns and
the intentions that guide them.</p>

<p>“After having arbitrarily suppressed the rights and
the possessions of the German princes in Alsace and
Lorraine, troubled and overset public order and their
legitimate government, exercised against the sacred person
of the King and against his august family violence which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_162"></a>[162]</span>
is (moreover) repeated and renewed from day to day,
those who have usurped the reins of the administration
have at last filled up the measure by causing an unjust
war to be declared against his Majesty the Emperor, and
by attacking his provinces in the Netherlands.</p>

<p>“Several possessions of the German Empire have been
drawn into this oppression, and several others have only
escaped from a similar danger by yielding to the imperious
threats of the dominant party and its emissaries.</p>

<p>“His Prussian Majesty with his Imperial Majesty,
by the ties of a strict and defensive alliance, and himself
a preponderant member of the Germanic body (<i>sic</i>), has
therefore been unable to excuse himself from going to
the aid of his ally and of his fellow State (<i>sic</i>). And
it is under both these heads that he undertakes the
defence of that monarch and of Germany.</p>

<p>“To these great interests another object of equal
importance must be added, and one that is near to the
heart of the two sovereigns: it is that of ending the
domestic anarchy of France, of arresting the attacks
which are directed against the altar and the throne, of
re-establishing the legitimate power, of giving back to the
King the freedom and safety of which he is deprived,
and of giving him the means to exercise the lawful
authority which is his due.</p>

<p>“Convinced as they are that the healthy part of the
French people abhors the excesses of a party that enslaves
them, and that the majority of the inhabitants are impatiently
awaiting the advent of a relief that will permit
them to declare themselves openly against the odious
schemes of their oppressors, His Majesty the Emperor
and His Majesty the King of Prussia call upon them
to return at once to the call of reason and justice, of
order, of peace. It is in view of these things that I,
the undersigned, General Commander-in-Chief of the
two armies, declare—</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_163"></a>[163]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>“(1) That led into the present war by irresistible
circumstances, the two allied courts propose no object to
themselves but the happiness of France, and do not
propose to enrich themselves by annexation.</p>

<p>“(2) That they have no intention of meddling with
the domestic government of France, but only wish to
deliver the King, and the Queen, and the Royal Family
from their captivity, and procure for his Most Christian
Majesty that freedom which is necessary for him to call
such a council as he shall see fit, without danger and
without obstacle, and to enable him to work for the good
of his subjects according to his promises and as much as
may be his concern.</p>

<p>“(3) That the combined armies will protect all towns,
boroughs, and villages, and the persons and goods of all
those that will submit to the King, and that they will
help to re-establish immediately the order and police
of France.</p>

<p>“(4) That the National Guard are ordered to see to
the peace of the towns and country-sides provisionally,
and to the security of the persons and goods of all Frenchmen
provisionally, that is, until the arrival of the troops
of their Royal and Imperial Majesties, or until further
orders, under pain of being personally responsible; that
on the contrary, the National Guards who may have
fought against the troops of the allied courts, and who
are captured in arms, shall be treated as enemies, and
shall be punished as rebels and disturbers of the public
peace.</p>

<p>“(5) That the generals, officers, non-commissioned
officers, and privates of the French troops of the line are
equally ordered to return to their old allegiance and to
submit at once to the King, their legitimate sovereign.</p>

<p>“(6) That the members of departmental, district,
and town councils are equally responsible with their
heads and property for all crimes, arson, murders, thefts,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_164"></a>[164]</span>
and assaults, the occurrence of which they allow or do
not openly, and to the common knowledge, try to prevent
in their jurisdiction; that they shall equally be bound to
keep their functions provisionally until his Most Christian
Majesty, reinstated in full liberty, has further decreed;
or until, in the interval, other orders shall have been
given.</p>

<p>“(7) That the inhabitants of towns, boroughs, and
villages who may dare to defend themselves against the
troops of their Imperial and Royal Majesties by firing
upon them, whether in the open or from the windows,
doors, or apertures of their houses, shall be punished at
once with all the rigour of the laws of war, their houses
pulled down or burnt. All those inhabitants, on the
contrary, of the towns, boroughs, and villages who shall
hasten to submit to their King by opening their gates to
the troops of their Majesties shall be placed under the
immediate protection of their Majesties; their persons,
their goods, their chattels shall be under the safeguard
of the laws, and measures will be taken for the general
safety of each and all of them.</p>

<p>“(8) The town of Paris and all its inhabitants without
distinction shall be bound to submit on the spot, and
without any delay, to the King, and to give that Prince
full and entire liberty, and to assure him and all the
Royal Family that inviolability and respect to which the
laws of nature and of nations entitle sovereigns from
their subjects. Their Imperial and Royal Majesties
render personally responsible for anything that may
happen, under peril of their heads, and of military
execution without hope of pardon, all members of the
National Assembly as of the Districts, the Municipality,
the National Guards, the Justices of the Peace, and all
others whom it may concern. Their aforesaid Majesties
declare, moreover, on their word and honour as Emperor
and King, that if the Palace of the Tuilleries be insulted<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165"></a>[165]</span>
or forced, that if the least violence, the least assault, be
perpetrated against their Majesties, the King, the Queen,
and the Royal Family, and if steps be not at once taken
for their safety, preservation, and liberty, they, their
Imperial and Royal Majesties, will take an exemplary
and never-to-be-forgotten vengeance, by giving up the
town of Paris to military execution and to total subversion,
and the guilty rebels to the deaths they have
deserved. Their Imperial and Royal Majesties promise,
on the contrary, to the inhabitants of Paris to use
their good offices with his Most Christian Majesty to
obtain pardon for their faults and errors, and to take
the most vigorous measures to ensure their persons
and goods if they promptly and exactly obey the above
command.</p>

<p>“Finally, since their Majesties can recognise no laws
in France save those that proceed from the King in full
liberty, they protest in advance against any declarations
that may be made in the name of his Most Christian
Majesty, so long as his sacred person, those of the Queen
and of the Royal Family, are not really safe, for which
end their Imperial and Royal Majesties invite and beg his
Most Christian Majesty to point out to what town in the
immediate neighbourhood of his frontiers he may judge
it best to retire with the Queen and the Royal Family,
under good and sure escort that will be sent him for
that purpose, in order that his Most Christian Majesty
may be in all safety to call to him such deputies and
counsellors as he sees fit, call such councils as may please
him, see to the re-establishment of order, and arrange
the administration of his kingdom.</p>

<p>“Lastly, I engage myself, in my own private name
and in my aforesaid capacity, to cause the troops under
my command to observe everywhere a good and exact
discipline, promising to treat with mildness and moderation
all well-meaning subjects who may show themselves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_166"></a>[166]</span>
peaceful and submissive, and to use force with
those only who may be guilty of resistance and of recalcitrance.</p>

<p>“It is for these reasons that I require and exhort, in
the strongest and most instant fashion, all the inhabitants
of this kingdom not to oppose themselves to the march
and operations of the troops under my command, but
rather to give them on all sides a free entry and all the
good-will, aid, and assistance that circumstances may
demand.</p>

<p class="right">(Signed) “<span class="smcap">Charles William Ferdinand</span>,<br />
Duke of Brunswick-Lunebourg.”</p>

</div>

<p>With that weapon the insurrection was certain of all
Paris. Mandat, who had replaced Lafayette at the head
of the armed force in the town, was still loyal to the
King; he organised, as far as was possible, the forces
that he could count upon. The other side also prepared,
and the movements had all the appearance of troops
entrenching themselves before battle.</p>

<p>Danton went to Arcis and settled an income on his
mother in case of his death, came back to Paris, and on
the night of August the 9th the Sections named commissioners
to act. They met and formed the “insurrectionary
commune.” At eight the next morning they
dissolved the legal commune, kept Danton, and directed
the fighting of the morning.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the King had gathered in the Tuilleries
about 6000 men, and depended very largely upon the
thick mass of wooden buildings in the Carrousel for
cover. The Swiss Guard, whom the decree had removed,
were only as far off as Rueil, and were ordered
into Paris, over 1500. They were the nucleus, and with
them some 2000 of the National Guard, 1500 of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"></a>[167]</span>
old “Constitutional Guards,” and a group of “Gentilshommes.”
Mandat had ordered a battery of the National
Guard’s artillery to keep the Pont Neuf; they revolted
and joined the people, and Mandat himself, the chief of
the defence, was killed on the steps of the Hotel de
Ville. Danton, who had not slept, but had lain down
in Desmoulin’s flat till midnight, had been to the Hotel
de Ville since two in the morning, and he took before
posterity—in his trial—the responsibility of Mandat’s
death. He did more. He acted during the short night
(a night of calm and great beauty, dark and with stars)
as the organiser and chief of the insurrection. Especially
he appoints Santerre to lead the National Guard. On
these rapid determinations the morning broke, and the
first hours of the misty day passed in gathering the
forces.</p>

<p>Meanwhile all morning the King had waited anxiously
in the Tuilleries gardens, and asked Roederer, like a
king in comic opera, “when the revolt would begin.”</p>

<p>All night the tocsin had sounded, but the people
were slow to gather—“le tocsin ne rend pas”—and it was
not till the insurrectionary commune had done its work
that a great mob, partly armed, and in no way disciplined,
came into the Carrousel.</p>

<p>Westermann (riding, as was Santerre) came up to
parley with the Swiss Guard; he asked them in German
(which was his native tongue, for he was an Alsatian)
to leave the Tuilleries, and promised that if the guard
retired and left the palace un-garrisoned the people
would also retire. The Swiss—the only real soldiers in
Paris—replied that they were under orders, and when
Westermann retired to the crowd they opened fire.</p>

<p>Antoinette had said, “Nail me to the Palace,” and even
Louis, timid and uncertain, thought that the chances
were in his favour. Let only this day succeed, and the
city could be kept quiet till the allies should arrive;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168"></a>[168]</span>
that had been the boast in the Royalist journal of
August 1st; it was Louis’s hope now.</p>

<p>Had the Carrousel been a little more open, the
battle might have ended in favour of the garrison,
but the numerous buildings, on the whole, helped
the attack, and the Swiss, unable to deploy, fought,
almost singly, a very unequal fight. There were no
volleys except the first. Rapid individual firing from
the doors and windows of the palace, the crowd pressing
up through the narrowest space (but at a loss of hundreds
of lives), and finally, by the end which gave on the
“Grande Galerie” the Tuilleries were forced, the garrison
killed, and only a small detachment of the Swiss Guard
retreated through the gardens, firing alternate volleys,
and saving themselves by an admirable discipline.</p>

<p>But while the issue was still doubtful, Louis and his
family had gone slowly through the same gardens to the
Riding-school, and had taken refuge with the Assembly.
The noise of the fusillade came sharply in at the windows,
and the event was still uncertain when the Parliament
received the King and promised him protection. The
president opened for him a small door at the right of the
chair, and the King and Queen and their children watched
the meaningless resolutions through a grating as they sat
in the little dark box that gave them refuge. The debate,
I say, lacked meaning, but the battle grew full of meaning
as they heard it. The shots were less frequent, the noise
of the mob—the roar—was suddenly muffled in the walls
of the palace. The crowd had entered it. Then came
the few sharp volleys of the retreating guard right under
the windows of the Manège, and finally the firing ceased,
and the Assembly knew that their oath was of no value,
and that the Tuilleries had fallen. Louis also knew it,
eating his grotesque roast chicken in the silent and
hidden place that was the first of his prisons. He saw
in the bright light of the hall many of the faces that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_169"></a>[169]</span>
were to be the rulers of France, but for himself, in his
silence, he felt all power to be gone. He had become a
Capet—there was truth in the Republican formula. There
had been played—though few have said it, it should be
said—a very fine game. The stakes were high and the
Court party dared them. They played to win all that
the Kings had possessed, and for this great stake they
risked a few foolish titles without power. The game was
even; it was worth playing, and they had lost. But the
man who had been their puppet and their figure-head
hardly knew what had happened. Perhaps the Queen
alone comprehended, and from that moment found the
proud silence and the glance that has dignified her end.
In her the legend of the lilies had found its last ally, but
now the great shield was broken for ever.</p>

<p>So perished the French monarchy. Its dim origins
stretched out and lost themselves in Rome; it had already
learnt to speak and recognised its own nature when the
vaults of the Thermae echoed heavily to the slow footsteps
of the Merovingian kings. Look up that vast valley
of dead men crowned, and you may see the gigantic figure
of Charlemagne, his brows level and his long white beard
tangled like an undergrowth, having in his left hand the
globe and in his right the hilt of an unconquerable sword.
There also are the short, strong horsemen of the Robertian
house, half-hidden by their leather shields, and their sons
before them growing in vestment and majesty, and taking
on the pomp of the Middle Ages; Louis VII., all covered
with iron; Philip the Conqueror; Louis IX., who alone
is surrounded with light: they stand in a widening interminable
procession, this great crowd of kings; they loose
their armour, they take their ermine on, they are accompanied
by their captains and their marshals; at last, in
their attitude and in their magnificence they sum up in
themselves the pride and the achievement of the French
nation. But time has dissipated what it could not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170"></a>[170]</span>
tarnish, and the process of a thousand years has turned
these mighty figures into unsubstantial things. You
may see them in the grey end of darkness, like a
pageant all standing still. You look again, but with the
growing light and with the wind that rises before morning
they have disappeared.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE REPUBLIC<br />
<span class="smcap">August 10, 1792—April 5, 1793</span></span></h2>

</div>

<p>The 10th of August is not, in the history of the Revolution,
a turning-point or a new departure merely; it is
rather a cataclysm, the conditions before and after which
are absolutely different. You may compare it to the rush
of the Atlantic, which “in one dreadful day and night”
swept away the old civilisation in the legend. It is like
one of the geological “faults” which form the great inland
escarpments, and to read or to write of it is like standing
on the edge of Auvergne. You have just passed through
a volcanic plateau, rising slowly, more and more desolate:
you find yourself looking down thousands of feet on to the
great plain of Limagne.</p>

<p>There is no better test of what the monarchy was than
the comparison of that which came before with that which
succeeded its overthrow. There is no continuity. On the
far side of the insurrection, up to the 9th of August itself,
you have armies (notably that of the centre) contented with
monarchy; you have a strong garrison at the Tuilleries, the
ministers, the departments, the mayor of Paris (even) consulting
with the crown. The King and the Girondins are
opposed, but they are balanced; Paris is angry and expectant,
but it has expressed nothing—it is one of many
powers. The moderate men, the Rolands and the rest,
are the radical wing. It is a triumph for the Revolution
that the Girondins should be again in nominal control.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_172"></a>[172]</span>
Pétion is an idol. The acute friction is between a government
of idealists standing at the head of a group of professional
bourgeois, and a crown supported by a resurrected
nobility, expecting succour and strong enough to hazard a
pitched battle.</p>

<p>Look around you on the 11th of August and see what
has happened. Between the two opponents a third has been
intervened—Paris and its insurrectionary Commune have
suddenly arisen. The Girondins are almost a reactionary
party. The Crown and all its scaffolding have suddenly
disappeared. The Assembly seems something small, the
ministry has fallen back, and there appears above it one
man only—Danton, called Minister of Justice, but practically
the executive itself. A crowd of names which had
stood for discussion, for the Jacobins, for persistent ineffective
opposition, appear as masters. In a word, France
had for the moment a new and terrible pretender to the
vacant throne, a pretender that usurped it at last—the
Commune.</p>

<p>The nine months with which this chapter will deal
formed the Republic; it is they that are the introduction
to the Terror and to the great wars, and from the imprisonment
of the King to the fall of the Girondins the
rapid course of France is set in a narrowing channel
directly for the Mountain. The Commune, the body
that conquered in August, is destined to capture every
position, and, as one guarantee after another breaks
down, it will attain, with its extreme doctrines and their
concomitant persecution, to absolute power.</p>

<p>What was Danton’s attitude during this period?
It may be summed up as follows: Now that the Revolution
was finally established, to keep France safe in the
inevitable danger. He put the nation first; he did not
subordinate the theory of the Revolution; he dismissed
it. The Revolution had conquered: it was there; but
France, which had made it and which proposed to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_173"></a>[173]</span>
extend the principles of self-government to the whole
world, was herself in the greatest peril. When discussion
had been the method of the Revolution, Danton
had been an extremist. He was Parisian and Frondeur
in 1790 and 1791; it was precisely in that time that he
failed. The tangible thing, the objective to which all
his mind leaned, appeared with the national danger;
then he had something to do, and his way of doing it,
his work in the trade to which he was born, showed him
to be of a totally different kind from the men above
whom he showed. I do not believe one could point to
a single act of his in these three-quarters of a year which
was not aimed at the national defence.</p>

<p>It is a point of special moment in the appreciation of
his politics that Danton was alone in this position. He
was the only man who acted as one of the innumerable
peasantry of France would have acted, could fate have
endowed such a peasant with genius and with knowledge.
The others to the left and right were soldiers, poets, or
pedants every one. Heroic pedants and poets who were
never afraid, but not one of them could forget his theories
or his vision and take hold of the ropes. Such diplomacy
as there is is Danton’s; it is Danton who attempts
compromise, and it is Danton who persistently recalls the
debates from personalities to work. It is he who warns
the Girondins, and it is he who, in the anarchy that followed
defeat, produced the necessary dictatorship of the
Committee. Finally, when the Committee is formed, you
glance at the names, the actions, and the reports, and you
see Danton moving as a man who can see moves among
the blind. He had been once “in himself the Cordeliers”—it
had no great effect, for there was nothing to do but
propose rights; now, after the insurrection, he became “in
himself the executive,” and later “in himself the Committee.”
So much is he the first man in France during
these few months of his activity, that only by following<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_174"></a>[174]</span>
his actions can you find the unity of this confused and
anarchic period.</p>

<p>It falls into four very distinct divisions, both from the
point of view of general history and from that of Danton’s
own life. The first includes the six weeks intervening
between the 10th of August and the meeting of the Convention;
it is a time almost without authority; it moves
round the terrible centre of the massacres. During this
brief time the executive, barely existent, without courts
or arms, had him in the Ministry of Justice as their one
power—a power unfortunately checked by the anarchy
in Paris.</p>

<p>The second division stretches from the meeting of the
Convention to the death of the King. It covers exactly
four months, from the 20th of September 1792 to the
21st of January 1793. It is the time in which the
danger of invasion seems lifted, and in which Danton in
the Convention is working publicly to reconcile the two
parties, and secretly to prevent, if possible, the spread
of the coalition against France.</p>

<p>The third opens with the universal war that follows
the death of Louis, and continues to a date which you
may fix at the rising of the 10th of March, or at the
defeat of Neerwinden on the 19th. Danton is absent
with the army during the greater part of these six weeks;
he returns at their close, and when things were at their
worst, to create the two great instruments which he
destined to govern France—the Tribunal and the Committee.</p>

<p>Finally, for two months, from the establishment of
these to the expulsion of the Girondins on the 2nd of
June, he is being gradually driven from the attempt at
conciliation to the necessities of the insurrection. He is
organising and directing the new Government of the
Public Safety, and in launching that new body, in imposing
that necessary dictator, we shall see him sacrificing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_175"></a>[175]</span>
one by one every minor point in his policy, till at last
his most persistent attempt—I mean his attempt to save
the Girondins—fails in its turn. Having so secured an
irresistible government, and having created the armies,
the chief moment of his life was past. It remained to
him to retire, to criticise the excesses of his own creation,
and to be killed by it.</p>

<p class="tb">Immediately after the insurrection, a week after he
had taken the oath and made the short vigorous speech
to the Assembly,<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> Danton sent out his first and almost
his only act as Minister of Justice, the circular of the
18th of August,<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> which was posted to all the tribunals
in France. It is peculiar rather than important; it is
the attempt to convince the magistracy and all the courts
of the justice and necessity of the insurrection, and at the
same time to leave upon record a declaration of his own
intentions now that he had reached power. In the first
attempt he necessarily fails. The old judicature, appointed
by the Crown and by the moderate ministers,
largely re-elected by the people, wealthy for the most
part, conservative by origin and tradition, would in any
case have rejected such leadership; but the matter is
unimportant; this passive body, upon which the reaction
had counted not a little, and which De Cicé had planned
to use against the Revolution, was destined to disappear
at the first demand of the new popular powers. France
for weeks was practically without courts of law.</p>

<p>Those passages, on the other hand, in which Danton
makes his own apology are full of interest. They contain
in a few sentences the outline of all his domestic policy,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_176"></a>[176]</span>
and we find in them Danton’s memories, his fears of what
his past reputation might do to hurt him.</p>

<p>“I came in through the breach of the Tuilleries,
and you can only find in me the same man who was
president of the Cordeliers.... The only object of my
thoughts has been political and individual liberty, ... the
maintenance of the laws, ... the strict union of all the
Departments, ... the splendour of the State, and the
equality, not of fortune, for that is impossible, but of
rights and of well-being.”</p>

<p>If we except the puerilities of the new great seal, the
Hercules with eighty-four stars (to represent the union of
the Departments), replaced by the conventional Liberty
and fasces, there is practically nothing more from Danton
as Minister of Justice. But as the one active man in the
Cabinet he is the pivot of the whole time. Those
qualities in him which had so disgusted the men of
letters were the exterior of a spirit imperatively demanded
in Paris at the time. His heavy, rapid walk,
the coarseness and harshness of his voice, his brutality in
command, exercised a physical pressure upon the old
man Roland, the mathematician Monge, and the virtuous
journalists who accompanied them. I know of but one
character in that set which could have prevented Danton’s
ascendancy, and have met his ugly strength by a force as
determined and more refined. Roland’s wife might have
done it, but though she was the soul of the ministry, she
was hardly a minister, and being a woman, she was confined
to secondary and indirect methods. Her hatred of
Danton increased to bitterness as she saw him succeed,
but she could not intervene, and France was saved from
the beauty and the ideals which might have been the
syrens of her shipwreck.</p>

<p>The three weeks following the 10th of August were
filled with the news of the invasion. The King of Prussia
had hesitated to march. France, full of herself, never<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_177"></a>[177]</span>
understood that such a thing was possible. The kings
were on the march, the great and simple ideas, so long in
opposition, had met in battle. All France thought that
1792 was already 1793. Perhaps there were only two
men in the country who saw the immaturity, the complexity,
and the chances of the situation—I mean Danton
and Dumouriez: Dumouriez, because he was by nature a
schemer who had seen and was to see the matter from
close at hand; Danton, because, from the first moment of
his entrance into the ministry, he had gathered up the
threads of negotiation into his hand.</p>

<p>The King of Prussia had hesitated, so had Brunswick.
It was the success of the insurrection that decided them.
They made the error that the foreigner always makes,
the error that led the most enlightened Frenchmen to
exaggerate the liberal forces in England, the error of seeing
ourselves in others. They imagined that “the sane
body of the nation,” the Frenchmen that thought like
Prussians, would rise in defence of the monarchy and in
aid of the invasion. They had no conception of how
small in number, how hesitating, and how vile were the
anti-national party.</p>

<p>On Sunday the 19th the frontier was crossed; on the
Thursday Longwy capitulated, and a German garrison
held the rocky plateau that overlooks the plain of Luxembourg.
A week later, Thursday the 30th, Verdun was
surrounded.</p>

<p>From the hills above the town, the same hills which
make of Verdun the fifth great entrenched camp of
modern France, the Prussian batteries bombarded with
a plunging fire. There may have been food and ammunition
for two or three more days, but fire had broken out
in several quarters, and the town council was imploring
Beaurepaire to surrender. Brunswick proposed a truce
and terms of capitulation. On the Saturday, the 1st of
September, after a violent discussion, the terms were<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_178"></a>[178]</span>
rejected, but Beaurepaire knew that nothing could save
the town, and in the night he shot himself. On the
next day, Sunday the second, Verdun yielded and the
road to Paris lay open.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, in the capital itself, a vortex was opening,
and the poor remnants of public authority and of public
order were being drawn down into it. The 10th of
August had been a victory into which there entered three
very dangerous elements. First, it was not final; it had
been won against a small local garrison under the menace
of an invasion, and this invasion was proving itself irresistible.
Secondly, it had left behind it terrors accentuated
by success; I mean whatever fears of vengeance or
of the destruction of Paris existed before the insurrection
were doubled when so much greater cause had been given
for the “execution” that Brunswick had threatened.
Finally, the success of the insurrection had of itself
destroyed the last shadow of executive power, for all
such power, weak and perishing though it was, had
centred in the King.</p>

<p>But besides these clear conditions which the 10th of
August had produced, there was something deeper and
more dangerous—the fear which fed upon itself and
became panic, and which ran supported by anger growing
into madness. There was no news but made it worse,
no sight in the streets and no rumour but increased the
intolerable pressure. Trade almost ceased, and the whole
course of exchange, which is the blood of a great city,
seemed to have run to the heart. Over the front of the
Hotel de Ville hung that enormous black flag with the
letters “Danger” staring from it in white, and in the
heavy winds another blew out straight and rattled from
the towers of Notre Dame. Every action savoured of
nightmare, and suffered from a spirit grotesque, exaggerated,
and horrible. The very day after the fight a great
net had been cast over Paris and drawn in full of royalists.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_179"></a>[179]</span>
The gates had been shut suddenly, and every suspect
arrested by order of the Commune. The prisons were full
of members of the great conspiracy, for in civil war the
vanquished appear as traitors. Then there arose a violent
demand for the trial and punishment of those who had
called in the foreigner, and a demand as violent, touching
on miracle, for innumerable volunteers. In every project
there ran this spirit of madness mixed with inspiration.</p>

<p>If Paris lost its head, so did the Assembly and the
Moderates, but in another fashion. Paris was pale with
the intensity of anger, Roland from a sudden paralysis.
The fear of Paris was an angry panic; with the Girondins
it was the sudden sickness that takes some men at the
sight of blood. Paris had clamoured for an excess when
it demanded the trial of the Swiss, who had done nothing
beyond their mercenary duty; but the executive met it
by an excess of weakness when it produced its court of
ridiculous and just pedants, afraid to condemn, afraid to
decide. Already the people had learned the secret payments
of the old civil list,<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> the salaries paid to the
emigrants, the subsidised press. Golier’s report had
appeared but a day before the invasion.</p>

<p>The news of Longwy was already known. Verdun
stood in peril, when the acquittal of Montmorin on Friday
the 31st seemed to be the deciding weakness of the
government that pushed the populace to their extreme
of violence.</p>

<p>He had been governor of Fontainebleau, openly and
patently a conspirator on the side of the Tuilleries; he
was not acquitted of this. It was admitted that he had
“planned civil war;” he was released by that heroic but
fatal fault of the Girondins, the fault that later sent them
to the guillotine, and that now inspired their tribunal—they
would not bend an inch to compromise with necessity;
rather than do so they would deliberately aggravate the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_180"></a>[180]</span>
worst conditions by inclining against the passions of the
moment. They seemed to say, “You clamour for mere
reprisals; we will show, on the contrary, that we are just,
and we will even irritate you with mercy.” Yet they
knew that Montmorin deserved death.</p>

<p>After that decision, and when Osselin the judge took
with great courage the prisoner’s arm in his own and led
him away, a voice in the court cried out, “You acquit him
now, and in a fortnight his friends will march into Paris.”
The massacres were certain from that moment; the thing
had been said which made the small band of murderers
start out, which made Paris look on immovable, and
which kept the National Guard silent, refusing to stop
the carnage. “We will go to the frontier, but we will
not leave enemies behind us. If the law will not execute
them, the people will.” The damnable spirit which runs
in colonies and wild places had invaded civilised Europe,
and the lynching was determined.</p>

<p>When the Assembly had yielded to the Commune,
when it was certain that the insurrectionary Commune
would have its own way, and when it was known that
Longwy had fallen, that Verdun was surrounded, there
took place one of those scenes that stand out like
pictures in the mind, and that interpret the characters
of history for us better than any accumulation of detail.</p>

<p>In the garden of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, at
its end, and away from the house, and under the low
foliage, the six ministers were met in an informal gathering—rapid,
half-silent, a council not predetermined,
suited to the time; a few hurried words, whose description
has come down to us by no minute, but by the
accident of Fabre’s presence. Fabre d’Eglantine, the
uncertain poet, Danton’s protégé, and dangerous, ill-balanced
friend,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> stood watching at a little distance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_181"></a>[181]</span></p>

<p>Roland spoke for all his friends. He was very pale
and broken-down; he leaned his head against a tree—“We
must leave Paris.” Danton spoke louder, “Where
do you mean to go?” “We must go to Blois. We
must take with us the King and the treasure.” So said
Servan; so said Clavière. Kersaint, whom Danton had
known at the old Commune in 1791, and who was something
of Danton’s kind, added his word: “I have just
come from Sedan, and I know there is nothing else to be
done. Brunswick will be here in Paris within the fortnight
as surely as the wedge enters when you strike.”
Danton stopped six waverers by a phrase, a phrase of
just such a character, exaggerated, violent, as his good
sense made use of so often in the tribune. “My mother
is seventy years old, and I have brought her to Paris; I
brought my children yesterday. If the Prussians are to
come in, I hope it may be into a Paris burnt down with
torches.” Then he turned round to Roland in person and
threw out a fatal sentence, necessary, perhaps, but one
of many that dug the great gulf between him and the
Girondins. “Take care, Roland, and do not talk too much
about flight; the people might hear you.”<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">[117]</a></p>

<p>I know of no anecdote that tells more about Danton,
or explains with greater clearness his attitude during the
crisis that brought on the massacres. For these over-vigorous
words, full of excess, were uttered by a man
whose character was all for material results—results
obtained, as a rule, by compromise. This same Danton,
who talked of “torches” and “Paris en cendres,” was
the only man in France who had the self-control to
negotiate for the retreat of the Prussians after Valmy.
His “mother of seventy years” had indeed been brought
to Paris, but from Arcis, which every one knew to be
right in the track of the invasion. What we have to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_182"></a>[182]</span>
discover in this speech, as in every phrase he uttered, is
the motive; for with any other of the great Revolutionaries
words were the whole of the idea, and sometimes more
than the idea, but with Danton alone words were the
means to a tangible end.</p>

<p>He desired to prevent that fatal breach with Paris
which he had foreseen to be a risk from the beginning,
and which Mirabeau in his time had thought so near as
to be necessary. He was determined to keep this shadow—the
national executive—in reach of the one thing that
was alive and vigorous and defending the nation. It is
of the greatest importance in appreciating his attitude
to know that he dreaded the Commune. Later, no one
of the deputies of Paris in the Convention saw as he saw
the necessity of amalgamation with the Departments.
Marat he thoroughly despised. Most of the men of the
Commune had sat in one room with him; Panis and
Sergent had even desks under him. He knew them,
and he contemned them all. He did not know to what
crimes they were about to commit themselves, or perhaps
he would have interfered, but he knew they were worthless.</p>

<p>Behind them, however, he saw Paris, and in Paris he
ardently believed, in its position and in its necessity. He
was entirely right. Once let the ministers leave the city,
and civil war would begin—a civil war waged within
ten days’ march of the enemy, and between what forces?
An imbecile, a man like one of our moderns, who thinks
in maps and numbers, would have said, “Between eighty-three
departments and one.” But Danton knew better.
He had that appreciation which is common to all the
masters; he knew the meaning of potential and of the
word ‘quality.’ It would have been a fight between the
members and the brain, and the brain would have died
fighting, leaving a body dead because the brain had
died.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_183"></a>[183]</span></p>

<p>Thus while the Assembly and the Commune fight
their sharp battle of the last days of August, while the
Parliament commands new municipal elections, breaks the
municipality, then flatters it, then yields and permits it
to be practically reinforced under the form of a fresh
vote from the Sections,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> Danton acts as though both
Parliament and Commune had dropped from the world.
There are two speeches of his, one of the 28th of
August, one of the 2nd of September, and between
them they mark his attitude and form also the origins
of that full year of action and rhetoric which define
him in history.</p>

<p>In the first, he proposes and carries the measure
which has been made an excuse for laying upon his
shoulders the responsibility of the massacres. The speech
was made for a very different purpose. He authorised
the domiciliary visits, but his object was to obtain arms.
One thought only occupied him: to counteract the intense
individualism of the Moderates, to force despotic measures
through a Parliament that hated them, and to force these
measures because without them the situation was lost.
He got his arms, and just afterwards his mass of volunteers,
but the other measure which he had introduced
to pacify the Commune, the domiciliary visits, have
marked more deeply in the memories of the time, because
in the troubled days that followed these visits seemed to
be a beginning.</p>

<p>It was Sunday morning, the 2nd of September. Verdun
(though no one knew it yet in Paris) had just fallen;
Beaurepaire was dead. The “Comité de Surveillance”
of the Commune had admitted Marat illegally,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> and for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_184"></a>[184]</span>
a sinister reason. For three days the prisons had been
marked, and those whom the Comité wished to save
had been withdrawn; and though the movement was
spontaneous, though the most of the Sections spoke before
Marat,<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">[120]</a> yet there was an executive and a directory, and
that madman was its chief. The moment that the
massacres were beginning at the Carmes, Danton was
making the last effort to turn the anger of the moment
into an enthusiasm for the Champ de Mars and for the
volunteers. If ever there was an attempt to influence by
rhetoric a popular emotion which could not be checked,
and to direct energy from a destructive to a fruitful
object, it is to be found in this his most famous speech—the
speech that even the children know to-day in France,
the closing words of which are engraved upon his
pedestal. For the only time in his life he turned and
leant upon the mere power of words: there is something
in their extraordinary force which savours of despair, and
they rise at the close to an untranslatable phrase in which
you hear rhythm for the first and last time in his appeals:
“De l’audace, encore de l’audace, toujours de l’audace—et
la France est sauvée.”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">[121]</a></p>

<p>He did not wholly fail. When he had rung the great
bell of the Hotel de Ville and had gone to the Champ de
Mars, he looked over a great and growing crowd of young
men running to the enlistment. But for four days—days
in which he doggedly turned his back to the Commune
which called him—the killing went on in the prisons. He
and his volunteers, his silence, were most like this: a man
in a mutiny on ship-board, in a storm at night, keeping
the helm, saving what could be saved and careless whether<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_185"></a>[185]</span>
the morning should make him seem a traitor on the one
hand or a mutineer upon the other. For the tragedy of
those five days—the days of Sedan—always seems to be
passing in a thick night. We read records of action at
this or that hour in the daylight, but we cannot believe
the sun shone. Maillard, tall and pale in his close black
serge and belt, is a figure for candles on the Abbaye table
and for torches in the cloisters and the vaults. There never
was a horror more germane to darkness.</p>

<p>But why did Danton not save the prisoners? I know
that question is usually answered by saying that he was
indifferent. So much (it seems to me) survives of a
legend. For history no longer pretends that he organised or
directed the crime. Indeed, history finds it daily more difficult,
as the details accumulate, to fix it upon any one man.
But the fact that he persistently defended the extremists
in the following month, that he made himself (for the
purposes of reunion) an advocate for many men who were
blameworthy, and tried to reconcile the pure minds of
the Girondins with such terrible memories—in a word,
the fact that for months he sacrificed himself in the
Convention, that he demanded union, has condemned him
to every suspicion. <i>Que mon nom soit flétri et que la France
soit libre.</i></p>

<p>He might, indeed, have spoken. Popular, the one
vigorous and healthy personality in the face of Paris, he
might have bent his energy to the single aim of preventing
an outbreak. I will not deny that in his mind, over
which we have seen passionate anger falling suddenly in
October 1789 and in June 1792, there may have arisen
some such feeling as that which restrained the vast mass
of the Parisians from interfering with the little band of
murderers—a feeling of violent hatred, a memory of the
manifesto and a disgust which made the partisans of Brunswick
seem like vermin. There is something of that deplorable
temper in the anecdote which Madame Roland<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_186"></a>[186]</span>
gives of him, striding through the rooms on the second
day and saying that the prisoners “could save themselves.”
But this anecdote is not history; it is an accusation, and
one made by a partisan and an enemy.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> There is another
and better reason for his action, which must, I think, have
made the greater part of his motive. To have spoken
would have been to play a very heavy stake. If he spoke
and failed to prevent the rising, he ceased to be Danton.
His influence fell, he became a Moderate, and himself, the
one man left to direct affairs, entered the confused ranks
of opposition—un-Parisian, rejected of either party, while
France beneath him fell into mere anarchy.</p>

<p>It would have been gambling with all that he most
desired: the English neutrality, the union of the coming
Parliament, the rapid organisation of the armies, all this
staked to win something that was not precious to him at
all—the lives of a mass of men the bulk of whom had
demanded the success of the invasion.</p>

<p>Why did he not act? Because nobody could act.
Remember the phrase which he delivered while Louis
was being executed four months later: “Nulle puissance
humaine.”<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> We are so accustomed to an aristocratic and
orderly society that a title of office implies power. The
Home Secretary or some other man “does this,” but the
man who really does it—does it with his hands—is the
policeman or the soldier. Now these did not exist at the
moment in Paris. It explains a hundred things in the
Revolution to remember that every successive step reduced
society to powder, to a mere number of men. Rousseau
had said that this compact, this thing based on voluntary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_187"></a>[187]</span>
union, was not made for the cities. Paris gave us in
September an awful proof. Roland, a man whom Marat
had put upon his list and whom Danton had saved, talked
on the Monday of the “just anger of the people.” Yet
Roland was a just man, and brave in matters that affected
himself alone, and the massacres chiefly concerned him.
He was Minister of the Interior, that is, responsible for
order, but there was nothing with which to work. On the
Tuesday he sent to Santerre and said, “Call out the
National Guard.” Santerre answered that he could not
gather them. He was right. Again, Pétion was an
honest man, a Moderate, the mayor of Paris; all he could
do was to sit at a useless committee of the Sections and talk
of the “National Defence;” that utter disintegration which
the theories of the Revolution had produced—that purely
voluntary condition of the soldier, the official, the police
(a mere anarchy)—was irresistible when there was spontaneity
of action; it was useless where the conditions
demanded organisation and initiative. It withstood the
cannonade at Valmy, it stormed the height of Jemappes,
but it fled in rout when the spring had melted enthusiasm.
So here police, the function that most requires discipline, was
lacking in the State. And the whole situation is summed
up in the sharp picture we have of Manuel pushing his
way though the crowd with “two policemen” who had
“volunteered,” and trying in vain to stop the lynching at
the Carmes. It was to this anarchy that Danton, after
six months of struggle, succeeded in giving government
during 1793.</p>

<p>Danton himself, after four months of vain effort to
reconcile his enemies, put the whole matter in the last
phrase of his defence: “No human power” could have
stopped the massacres;<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> all that could be done was to
work, from that moment forward, against the extreme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_188"></a>[188]</span>
theories of a voluntary state, and towards the establishment
of a strong government.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>When, on the Thursday, September 6, the wave receded,
and when on the morrow Pétion was able to
interfere, the people and the Assembly looked round them
and saw that a thing had happened which was to hurt
the future of the Revolution more than all the armies.
It was like the breaking of day after that moral night, a
daybreak in which the wind goes down and you see the
wreckage.</p>

<p>Paris was very silent; the accusations had not yet
begun; the Assembly was dying. The electoral council
of Paris had met during the very days of the massacre,
and had proceeded to choose the members who were to
represent the capital in the Convention that was about to
meet. It also voted in silence, and sat in the mingled panic
and remorse that oppressed the whole city. The names
came out in the balloting. On the 5th (the murderers
were still growling in the streets) Robespierre was elected in
a small meeting of 525; on the 6th Danton was elected
second, but with a much larger attendance and with a
much greater majority—638 votes out of an attendance
of 700, a curious result. Danton’s name forced itself
upon them, was acclaimed beyond any other; yet his
attitude of conciliation, his attempt to have all Paris
represented, was set aside. The man and his reputation
succeeded, his policy failed. They elected also Marat,
Panis, Sergent—those who had directed the crime. Danton
and Manuel alone of all the twenty-four had any
touch of the Moderate about them. The long list ends
with the name of Egalité, elected by a majority of one.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">[126]</a></p>

<p>There came, therefore, into the Convention an apparently<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_189"></a>[189]</span>
united body of men from Paris—the Mountain.
Up on the benches of the extreme left, in the grey, dark
theatre of the Tuilleries, there were to sit, in a compact
group, these extremists; and across the floor the Departments,
the pure Republicans of the south, who despised
the city and them, who feared them terribly, and who
hated with the force of a religion, were to single them
out as tyrants. And in this Mountain, this body of
Reds, Danton was to find himself imbedded, bound up,
falsified. He had determined to prevent such parties.
He had tried hard to make Paris elect not only Robespierre
but Pétion also as a mark of unity: he had failed.</p>

<p>When the country members came up to the capital,
September had grown to be an awful legend. The
number of those killed was multiplied ten times,<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> twenty
times—number lost meaning. Paris seemed a city of
blood. Guides volunteered story after story. “Here, in
the Abbaye, the blood had risen so high”—they made
a mark in the wall; “there, under that tree, the massacres
were planned by such and such a one”—any name
suited, sometimes it was Robespierre, sometimes Danton.
The deputies came from their little towns and from the
fields, over seven hundred—pilgrims from places where
the pure enthusiasms of 1790 still lingered, where even
1792 had brought no passion. They came, many of
them for the first time, bewildered in the enormous
city; its noise confused them, its crowds, its anger—“Yes;
that was where the massacres were committed a
fortnight ago—we can believe it.” The Convention from
its first day seemed a battlefield—Paris defiant in the
Mountain, and the Departments silent with an angry fear
in the plain and on the benches of the right. And when
the newcomers asked to be shown the group of deputies
for Paris, as men would ask to be shown lurking enemies<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_190"></a>[190]</span>
or wild beasts, they would have their gaze directed to that
high place on the left where sat the names that had
terrified and fascinated them in the prints of their
country-sides.</p>

<p>There were no windows; the skylight, high above
that deep well of a room, sent an insufficient light downwards
upon the foreheads, making the features sharp
and yet lending them a false gloom. That man with
the small squat body and the frog’s face was Marat; you
could just see his great vain mouth in the dim light.
Those small, keen features, well barbered and set up, the
high forehead, the pointed bones of the cheek and chin,
stood for Robespierre. The light fell chiefly on the white
of his careful wig; his thin smile was in shadow. And
who was that huge figure, made larger by the darkness
and carrying a head like Mirabeau? They saw it moving
when the others were fixed. He would speak to his
neighbours with heavy, sweeping gestures. They grew
accustomed to the half-light, and they could distinguish
his face—the strong jaw, the powerful movement of the
lips, torn and misshapen though they were; the rough,
pitted skin, the small, direct, and deep-set eyes. Who
was he? He seemed to them the very incarnation of
all the bloodshed and unreason which they hated in
Paris, a master of anarchy. It was Danton.</p>

<p>Against that impression all policy and wisdom broke.
He demanded unity; he checked the growing attack on
the rich; he said things that were like France speaking.
But the voice was harsh and loud; they heard it in their
minds at the head of mobs; they fled from him to the
Girondins; they forced him back upon the Mountain, and
he had to do his work alone in spite of those orators
whom he would have befriended and whose genius he
loved—in spite of those madmen who surrounded him,
and who later killed him and the Republic with one
axe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_191"></a>[191]</span></p>

<p>It was on the 25th of September, a Thursday, that
the Convention met in the Tuilleries; on the Friday, in
the same place, with doors shut and with the galleries
empty, they declared the Republic, and moved off to the
Manège, where their predecessors had sat. In those two
days the violent quarrel between Paris and France was
hushed for a moment. Danton, in the lull, said all he
could to define his own position and to prevent that
quarrel from ever reaching a head. He went out to
meet the Moderates. He declared, with the common
sense of the peasant, that property must first be declared
inviolable; and it is curious that the Convention, the
majority that misunderstood him and broke with him,
was yet less moderate than he; it passed the resolution,
but in the form, “property is under the safeguard of the
nation.” In order to calm opinion he resigned the
Ministry of Justice on the spot;<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> he did everything to
make his position clear and true, and to save the unity
of the Parliament.</p>

<p>But the attack came from the others. Within a
week Lasource had proposed a guard for the Convention,
“drawn from the departments;” and in the face of this
proposition, that was almost civil war, Danton found
himself able to speak once more for unity. The Girondins
had elected one of themselves for president, and had
chosen from among their own members the secretaries of
the Assembly; they had wittingly ostracised the left, and
they desired to make it dumb. Danton still attempted
union. “I myself come from the Departments, from a
place to which I always turn my eyes. But Paris is
made of the Departments, and we are not here as members
of this place or that, but as members for France.” He
continually presented the idea of France united; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_192"></a>[192]</span>
Girondins as continually rejected it. He knew that they
thought him a shield for Marat; he rejected Marat openly
from the tribune. But all this intense and personal
action had but an effect upon individuals. Two especially
it moved—Vergniaud, the young orator, sincere and brave
beyond all his colleagues, and more far-seeing than any
of the dreamers around him; Condorcet, to whom a year
before Danton had seemed so repulsive, but whose calm
and just mind had arrived at the truth; who had said,
“Danton has that rare faculty of neither hating nor envying
genius in others;” who had voted and spoken for his
appointment as Minister of Justice, and who, up to the
catastrophe of the following June, continued to understand
and to support him.</p>

<p>But, for the mass of the Girondins, he remained an
outcast. He used words that one could not use before
Roland’s wife, and the great group that surrounded her
(men over-full of utopias, but heroic, men whom Danton
himself regretted bitterly) made him an outcast. He
replied often with passion, and once with insult, but as
we shall see he did not abandon them entirely till the
insurrection destroyed them in ’93.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, while they voted the Republic in Paris,
under Argonne a battle among the most curious in
history was making a momentary security—that is, a
momentary union of good feeling throughout France,
and even in Paris itself. The Prussian army had been
checked on the little rise of Valmy. As you stand upon
the field in that same season of the year to-day, in the
mist of the early morning, as the volunteers and the
battered remnants of the line stood then; as you look
from that standpoint at the open road, at the great plain
of Champagne, so well suited to maintain an army; as
you see to the east the long wall of the Argonne, and
remember that Dumouriez had been outflanked in his
Thermopylæ, a confusion seizes the mind. Why on earth<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_193"></a>[193]</span>
was Valmy so important a victory? It is a common-place
to say that Valmy was a cannonade, but what was a
cannonade in 1792? If indeed to-day a line of guns
were drawn up and served, as I have seen them served in
the manœuvres within sight of these same hills, and if a
force should be discovered capable of withstanding the
shrapnel of twelve batteries of artillery, sure of their
range, turning the mark into a ploughed field—then that
force would merit peculiar names, for it would be immortal.
But in the eighteenth century guns were not
the arbiters of battles. Infantry could charge the batteries
then. France, which was crushed yesterday and
will succeed to-morrow solely through artillery, had not
a hundred years ago to dread the random solid shot of
smooth bores; what she had to dread was the bayonet
charge of that superb infantry which the great Frederick
had trained, and on which the monstrous scaffolding of
Prussia still reposes. All we can say of Valmy is this,
that men quite ignorant of warfare, badly held together,
managed to stand firm under an ill-directed, at times
a desultory and distant cannon fire.</p>

<p>Valmy was not a victory. The results of Valmy
have changed the world, but no one could have seen it
then. Goethe, in the course of a long life, discovered it,
and put it beautifully into his own mouth over one of
the bivouac fires: “We entered on a new world then;”
but there were better prophets than Goethe, and not one
perceived it. For days the Prussian army hesitated.
Dumouriez did not dare to meet them. A pitched battle
in the last days of September might have changed all
history.</p>

<p>Why then did the King of Prussia retreat? No
force compelled, but two arguments convinced him. The
peasantry, and Danton, the man who through the whole
year is, as it were, a peasant trained and illumined. The
resistance of the peasantry had taught the King that to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_194"></a>[194]</span>
reach Paris it required not a war of the dynasties, such
as had filled the eighteenth century—wars in which
armies passed like visiting caravans; the invasion of
France would need a crusade. He was no crusader.
He had undertaken the war with only half a heart,
and at this slight check he hesitated. The second
argument came from Danton. He bargained like a
peasant secretly for the purchasable and obvious good,
while the Parliament was talking as might talk a
conqueror who was something of a poet and well
read in the classics. When there was a talk of
negotiations just after the battle, it launched the great
words, “That the Republic does not discuss till its territory
is evacuated.” That was on Tuesday; the Republic
was young to discuss anything—it was four days old. On
Wednesday night, Westermann, Danton’s man of the
10th of August, and his companion at the scaffold,
started off secretly to diplomatise. That foolish man
D’Eglantine followed him, but his folly was swallowed up
in the wisdom of Danton, who sent him, a secretary and
a mouthpiece, to do that which, had he done it himself,
would have produced some violent and ill-considered vote.
Between them this clique settled the matter, and the
invaders passed back through the Argonne heavily, in
wet roads and through drenched woods, with Kellermann
following, impatient, above the valleys, but bound by
Danton’s policy not to harass the retreat; till at last,
more than a month after Valmy,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">[129]</a> he fired the salute
from Longwy, and the territory was free.</p>

<p>Did Danton know, as he was pursuing these plans,
why Dumouriez helped him? Did he understand thoroughly
that vain, talented, and unprincipled soldier? I
think it certain. It is among those things which cannot
be proved; one does not base such convictions upon documents,
but rather on the general appreciation of character.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_195"></a>[195]</span>
Thus Danton undoubtedly helped and used Talleyrand
at another time in England, and Talleyrand was patently
false. But Talleyrand was, as patently, the cleverest
diplomatist he could find. Dumouriez wished the King
of Prussia to be left unmolested for a number of very
mixed reasons, in which patriotism played a small part;
Danton wished it for the sake of France, and for that
only; but if Dumouriez at the head of an army was to
hand, so much the better. Danton supported Dumouriez,
his policy, even his retreats up to the disaster of March.
To say “he sympathised with a traitor” is one of those
follies which men can only make when they forget that
contemporaries cannot have known what we know. With
all his time-serving and his separate plans, no one dreamt
that in six months the general would join the Austrians;
it was a sudden blow even to those who sat in his tent.</p>

<p>October was a month of reconciliation. When the
man broad awake succeeds, the dreamer is ready to build
a new dream on that result. The Gironde was almost
silent, the Mountain was afraid. In the short visit that
Dumouriez paid, between a victory and a victory, to Paris,
Danton appears for a moment a partner in the mental
ease, the brilliant expression, and the Republican faith of
the Girondins. He might perhaps have ended there, and
with his great arms and shoulders have held apart the men
whose mutual hatred killed the Republic. In his success—and
every one bore him gratitude after Valmy—that
which he most desired almost happened, and the alliance
between the opposing Girondist and the Mountain was
half realised.</p>

<p>Michelet gives us two pictures<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> which, like the revelation
of lightning, show us that rapid drama standing
still. In the first it is Madame Roland, in the second
Marat, who makes the tragedy. In the first Dumouriez
and Danton sat in the same box at the theatre, and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_196"></a>[196]</span>
Vergniaud was coming in with the soul of the Girondins.
The door opened and promised this spectacle: Danton
and the general and the orator of the pure Republicans,
and the woman most identified with the Right. It would
have been such a picture for all the people there as Danton
would have prayed or paid for. The door was ajar,
and, as she came near, Madame Roland saw Danton sitting
in the box; she put out her hand from Vergniaud’s
arm and shut the door. There is in her memoirs a kind
of apology,“des femmes de mauvaise tournure.” Utter
nonsense; it was Roland’s box, and his wife was expected.
Danton and Dumouriez were not of the gutter. No, it
was the narrow feminine hatred, so closely allied to her
intense devotion, that made Madame Roland thrust Danton
at arm’s length. The same spirit that made her
vilify the Left like a fury made her the calm saint of the
Girondins. For she lived entirely in the Idea.</p>

<p>The second scene is a reception. I will not repeat
Michelet’s description; its spirit is contained in an admirable
phrase: “France civilised appealed therein against
France political.” Danton was surrounded with those
whom he would have taught, as he taught all who ever
knew him closely, to respect or to love him. Marat
heard that he was there—Marat, whom he had repudiated
in public a few days before. He heard that Danton was
there, surrounded by the soldiers, and the women, and
the orators. He called at the door, and shouted in the
hall, “I want to see Danton,” and at the sound of his
voice everybody grew troubled, and Danton was left
alone. On the 29th of October Danton attempted
openly to break with Marat: “I declare to you and to
France,” he said in the Convention, “that I have tried
Marat’s temperament, and I am no friend of his.” But
the attempt came too late.</p>

<p>The discussions broke out again in November. On
the 10th, the victory of Jemappes was heard in Paris.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_197"></a>[197]</span>
This book, dealing only with a man, cannot detail those
famous charges; it was a victory won by men singing
the new songs; it is the inspiration of “La victoire en
chantant.” But the security it gave only went further
to destroy what was left of union. Danton found himself
more and more alone. He who had been named on
a committee with Thomas Paine, with Condorcet, with
Pétion, on the very day after his election to the presidency
of the Jacobins,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> who had in his own temporary success
seemed to realise his policy of union, found himself after
a month once more pushed back towards the Mountain.
The growing sense of security had destroyed the chances
of union. He remained silent. One would say that the
time passed him by untouched, because the one thing he
cared for had failed, and because the inevitable civil dissensions
of the next spring covered his mind with clouds.
France was irretrievably divided. The arraignment of
the King, the discovery of the secret papers, all the
movement of November leaves him, as it were, stranded,
waiting his mission to Belgium.</p>

<p>There belongs to this period only one considerable
speech. It is the only thing in all his public acts in
which you can discover beauty. You may find in this
speech the pity and the tenderness which his intimates
loved, the memory which they for sixty years defended,
but which no document or letter remains to perpetuate.</p>

<p>Cambon, careless of anything but his exchequer, had
thought the new era come. That cold and inflexible
head determined, seeing the steep fall towards bankruptcy
that France was making, to save a hundred millions,
but to save it at an expense. He proposed to separate
the State from what was left of the Church, to break
the vow of 1790. In almost the last speech before he
went off to the armies, Danton opposed him and gave
this passage—a passage better fitted to the defence of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_198"></a>[198]</span>
an older and stronger thing than the wretched constitutional
priesthood:—</p>

<p>“... It is treason against the nation to take away
its dreams. For my part, I admit I have known but
one God. The God of all the world and of justice. The
man in the fields adds to this conception that of a man
who works, whom he makes sacred because his youth,
his manhood, and his old age owe to the priest then:
little moments of happiness. When a man is poor and
wretched, his soul grows tender, and he clings especially
to whatever seems majestic: leave him his illusions—teach
him if you will ... but do not let the poor fear
that they may lose the one thing that binds them to
earth, since wealth cannot bind them.”</p>

<p>Before he left on the mission to the armies there
occurred a scene which has always been, since Michelet described
it, the most striking passage of his relations with
the Girondins. He, the man who saw safety for France
only in diplomacy, had, for the sake of unity, held his
tongue when the Girondins passed the decree of the
19th November, which was to sustain a revolutionary
crusade against Europe. I say that November is full
of Danton’s attempt to maintain the unity of the Parliament.
After all these efforts he was worsted, because
the Girondins were possessed by a dream which admitted
of no compromise and of no realities.</p>

<p>The scene of his last attempt was this:—He made a
rendezvous with their party. They were to meet secretly
at night and away from Paris in a house in the woods of
Sceaux at the very end of November. The whole life
of this man was a tragedy, and we see in this sad journey
that kind of dramatic presentiment of his death and of
theirs, the “foreknowledge” with which the tragedies
of the world are filled.</p>

<p>He went through the desolate bare woods of November,
under the hurrying sky, that recalls to our minds<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_199"></a>[199]</span>
in France to-day the charges of Jemappes. The night
was as wild as the time, and as dark as his forebodings,
when he came on to the little group of men in the
candlelight, and argued with them, and against them,
and alone. Michelet gives to Danton’s mind a sentiment
of coercion. He shows us Danton dragged by
necessity. But I can see no necessity except the supreme
desire to unite the parties and make the government real.
They would not receive his alliance, and he went away
from that meeting at midnight, pushed back upon Paris,
thrown into the comradeship of violence. Guadet rejected
him with an especial fervour. Danton as he left
turned upon him with this phrase: “Guadet, Guadet,
you cannot understand and you do not know how to
forgive; you are headstrong, and it will be your doom.”
The next day he started on his mission to the army.</p>

<p>During the arraignment and during the trial of the
King the opinions that divided the Left and the Right
fought it out in his absence.<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">[132]</a> He was not there to
attempt such a movement as his character demanded.
No one in all the Assembly dared hold out a hand as
he would have done and see whether after all Vergniaud
might not perhaps be right on the one hand, and the
Mountain perhaps be patriots on the other.</p>

<p>There was in this debate upon one man’s life an
element to which Danton’s nature was well suited.
There had to be kept in view for the French nation the
effect upon Europe which would follow from the determination
as to the death or life of the King, and Danton’s
great voice has so strongly and so rightly affected the
historians of the period that he thrusts his personality
forward into their narrative, and in at least one notable
place Danton appears, in history, and in one of the greatest<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_200"></a>[200]</span>
pages of history, by no right, and figures upon scenes which
do not possess the advantage of his voice. He has been
made to defend Louis’s life, to plead for a respite, and then
by a violent change to vote for his death.</p>

<p>Let me now explain how this error passed into the
mind of Michelet and of other men. Danton returned
from Belgium on the night of the 14th January. On
that same day a certain Dannon, apparently an honest
man,<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">[133]</a> rose late in the evening and demanded respite for
Louis. When Gallois reprinted the <i>Moniteur</i>, he saw this
obscure name coupled with a politic demand; he read it
again, and said, “This Dannon must be a misprint for
Danton.” He corrected it so. On this chance venture
there fell the eye of Michelet, the eye that from a glance
or a word could bring back the colours and the movements
of living men. In him also the tragedy of Danton
powerfully worked; he moulded a figure from these few
words in the <i>Moniteur</i>, and made of them an admirable
anti-climax. Here was Danton (Dannon) hot from the
armies, knowing in what peril France stood, having seen
with his own eyes how momentary had been the effects
of Jemappes. He comes from his travelling coach to
the Assembly, and with the mud of the road yet upon
him, gives his expression as an ally to the Girondins and
to the Moderates. Then some rebuff, some unrecorded
insult throws him back again as he had been so often
thrown back into the arms of the Extremists. On the
next day, the 15th of January, we are asked to watch him
sitting by the side of his dying wife, sullen and despairing.
On the 16th he comes back furious, and votes for the death
of the King.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_201"></a>[201]</span></p>

<p>There are those for whom detail in history is pedantic,
yet here upon three letters and their order hangs the
interpretation not only of an individual character but
of a policy whose effects we are still feeling. Michelet’s
great picture is false from beginning to end. Danton had
returned on the 14th, and came jaded with his journey to
the bedside of her who had been his young wife of five
years, who was now near to childbirth and to death. He
had his own drama as well as that of the historian’s, and
our own dramas are acted upon a stage where the results
are real. All that night of the 14th and all the 15th
he was watching in his flat of the Passage du Commerce
a fate which was coming upon him, and certainly for
whose thirty-six hours the Revolution was a little thing
to him. He came back wearily to his position and to his
duties on the 16th; he remembered there was such a thing
as the Revolution—that Louis was after all on trial, and
descended from his home into the hall of the Parliament to
give the short angry sentence in which we seem to read less
moderation and less of diplomacy than was his by nature.
The scene in the home had made him not only bitter but
weak, for there is surely weakness in saying, “I am not a
statesman,” in borrowing, that is, the vulgar acrimony of
Marat, or in talking of “the tyrant,” and in repeating the
phrases of the Mountain.</p>

<p>But in the days that followed Michelet finds a good
excuse. Certainly one would say, if one knew nothing
about him except his action of January 1793, that Danton
was the Mountain and nothing else. This error would be
supported by the unreasoning vehemence, the almost
brutal anger, into which he allows himself to fall.</p>

<p>They asked whether the King could be condemned to
death by a mere majority, and whether that majority was
decisive. Danton threw back at them: “You decided
the Republic by a mere majority, you changed the whole
history of the nation by a mere majority, and now you<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_202"></a>[202]</span>
think the life of one man too great for a mere majority;
you say such a vote could not be decisive enough to make
blood flow. When I was on the frontier the blood flowed
decisively enough.”</p>

<p>So naturally was he at that moment the Danton of
unreason, so much had his character yielded to its persistent
temptation of violent words, that there could be heard
a voice once calling out to him as he rushed to the
tribune without leave from the Speaker, “You are not a
king yet, Danton.” And yet this was the man who had
saved France from any folly of defiance after Valmy, who
was determined upon saving her in the future by keeping
upon the helm a quiet and unswerving hand. Vergniaud’s
great simile, “That France might become, if she did not
take care, like the statues of Egypt; they astonish by their
greatness, and yet are enigmas to all who see them, because
the living spirit that made them has died,” passed him by
without effect. He was one of those who voted in the
fatal majority, and he threw down as gage of battle the
head of a king.<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">[134]</a></p>

<p class="tb">The word had become reality, and Louis had stood at
mid-day trying to be heard beyond the ring of soldiers,
had cried out that he was innocent, and had died in the
noon of that cold January day. This act was destined to
produce the one thing that Danton had most ardently
desired to avoid—it put an end once and for all to the
neutrality of England.</p>

<p>Another people, then in their infancy, now old, whom
Louis had been persuaded to help against his will, received
the death of Louis like a kind of blow in the face.
The people of the United States in their simplicity had
imagined the French king to be their saviour; they did<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_203"></a>[203]</span>
not know Louis’s phrase, “I was dragged into that unhappy
affair of America; advantage was taken of my
youth.” They regarded his crown with a certain superstition,
as they still regard what is left of baubles in
Europe; and when the axe fell upon him, France lost
not only the calculating hypocrisy of Pitt, but the genuine
sympathy of the American people.</p>

<p>In the days that followed (they were only ten) between
the 21st of January and the end of the month, it is still
plain that the shock which most affected Danton’s vigorous
and independent judgment was that return after seven
weeks to the wife whom he had passionately loved, and
whom this ugly Orpheus felt slipping from his arms back
into the shades. After her death, as we shall see, he did
not reel so heavily, but in that fortnight of January, which
was of such supreme importance, he permitted misfortune
to rouse mere passion in his mind; and he who might
have led the Moderates, who might have played with the
life of Louis like a card, chose to remember his rebuff in
the winter and threw his trump away.</p>

<p>Many have tried to explain Vergniaud’s vote. Is it
not probable that he was drawn by the example of a man
whom he did not understand, and whose opinion attracted
an orator not unappreciative of energy? Vergniaud has
always before history a doubting and a hesitating face,
and it seems more than possible that the wrath of Danton
carried him and many others into the vote for death.</p>

<p>Ever since the 10th of August had thrust him into
unexpected power, Danton had held in one way or another
the threads of a certain diplomacy. It was as follows:—To
rely upon all the elements in Europe which admired
or were indifferent to the Revolution, and to combine them
in a kind of resistant body; to use, as it were, their inertia
against those who were setting out as crusaders against
France. On this account the foolish war of propaganda
was most distasteful to him. On this account England’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_204"></a>[204]</span>
neutrality haunted his mind. He knew that in this
country there existed a body strong in its influence
though not in its numbers, a body which would have
supported the French. Priestley had written to him before
his exile. Talleyrand was working for him at the
moment, and opposing as an informal Dantonist the
Girondin acerbity of Chauvelin.<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">[135]</a> Danton was even willing
to use Dumouriez, mainly because Dumouriez was about
to compromise with England. To this policy of observation,
a policy which took advantage of England as the
lover of individual liberty and of England as the merchant,
the death of the King put a sudden stop. It was
Danton that killed his own intrigue.</p>

<p>Before he left on his second mission to the armies on
the 31st January 1793, he shows that new face in which
he attempts to retrieve, as far as possible, the errors of
which he had been largely the author. In a speech
which shows once again all his old power of party political
action, he demands the annexation of Belgium. He
has seen that general war is inevitable, and harking back
again to that unique French conception of which he was
the heir, the <i>raison d’état</i>, he determines to save the State,
and to do it by an action which opposed every theory of
the Revolution. He asked “everything of their reason,
nothing of their enthusiasm,” and he demanded the
annexation of Belgium with France. It was pure opportunism—the
determination to get hold of a revenue by
force of arms; and the next day, after having painfully
come back to his old policy of the real and objective,
burdened by a past error, and having broken with all that
he valued in French opinion, he went off again to the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_205"></a>[205]</span>
army. While his chaise was yet rolling on the flat roads
of Flanders, Chauvelin returned with Pitt’s scrawl in his
hand, and France was at war with the whole world.</p>

<p>This next voyage to Belgium occupied but a very
short time. He did not get there until the 3rd February,
and he started to come back on the 15th. But the
moment, which is necessarily a silent one in his biography,
would be one of capital importance to us had he remained
in Paris to speak, and to leave us by his speeches some
clue as to the revolution through which his mind had
passed.</p>

<p>Consider these contrasting pictures: Danton, up to
the death of the King, seems uniquely occupied in pursuing
the threads of a very careful diplomacy, and in
welding as far as possible the opposing factions of the
Parliament. Of course, his general theories in politics
remain unaltered, but something has happened which
makes him, on returning from Belgium for the second
time, pursue this different policy: the immediate construction
of a strong central government, and the providing
of it with exceptional and terrible machinery. He
works this as absolutely the unique policy. He seems to
have forgotten all questions of diplomacy, nearly to have
despaired of settling the quarrel between Paris and the
Girondins. In fine, Danton, when first in power, had
been a man so representative of France as to have many
different objects, and to attempt their co-ordination. We
see him the brief fortnight of Louis’s execution violent,
angry, unreasoning; we see him again in less than a
month transformed into a man with a single object, pursued
and succeeded in with the tenacity common to
minds much narrower than his own.</p>

<p>I know that events will largely account for the change.
The Girondins had repelled him; diplomacy had no further
object when once the universal war was declared; the
grave perils, and later the disasters of the French armies,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_206"></a>[206]</span>
which he had seen with his own eyes, called imperatively
for a dictatorship. Nevertheless events will not of themselves
account for the very great transformation in all
that he says and does. I believe that we must look to
another cause—one of those causes which historians
neglect, but which in the lives of individuals are of far
more importance than their political surroundings. By
nature he had great tendencies to indolence as well as
to violence. He was capable of temporising to a dangerous
extent, and this, I think, was largely the cause of his
action in the autumn. But such natures are also of the
kind which disaster spurs to action. As we have seen, the
return in January to his household, ruined by an impending
fate, made him the violent and bitter speaker who
spoiled his own plans by his own speeches. But returning
from Belgium in February, not a menace but a definite
disaster awoke in him a much more useful energy.</p>

<p>Coming from fields in which he had seen the whole
force of the early battles breaking up in confusion and
retreat, he had suddenly to meet the news of his wife’s
death. He bought a light carriage for himself in order
to travel with greater speed, and arrived at the city in
time, they say, to have her coffin taken out of the grave
and opened, so that he might look once more upon her
face. The home was entirely empty. The two little children,
one of whom was in arms, the other of whom was
just beginning to talk, had been taken away to their grandmother’s.
The seals were on the furniture and on the
doors. One servant only remained. The house had been
without a fire for a week when he entered. It was an opportunity
and a command for another origin in his political
life. Coming and going from these rooms, he found them
intolerable; he took refuge in direct and determined
action, calling to his aid all that vast reserve of energy
which he was accustomed to expend at the cost of so
much future exhaustion.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_207"></a>[207]</span></p>

<p>Here was the first thing to be done—to construct at
once that strong and simple government which he had
talked of so long. The report which he and the other
commissioners had prepared on the state of the army<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">[136]</a>
was one deliberately intended to make such a government
voted. The Commune of Paris immediately after the
preparation of the report made its vigorous appeal for a
further levy, and on the 8th of March Danton made the
first of those speeches which riveted the armour all round
France.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>In the first phrase of this speech he strikes the note
upon which depended so much of his power. He reads
his own character into that of the nation. “We have
often discovered before now that this is the temper of
the French people—namely, that it needs dangers to
discover all its energy.” Then he strikes the other note,
the appeal to Paris which had marked so much of his
career. “Paris, which has been given so ill a fame” (a
stroke at the Girondins), “I say is called once more to
give France the impulse which last year produced all
our triumphs. We promised the army in Belgium 30,000
men on the 1st of February. None have reached them.
And I demand that commissioners be named to raise a
force in the forty-eight Sections of Paris.”</p>

<p>If there was some talk at that moment of making
him Minister of War after Beurnonville’s resignation, it
was because no one but Danton himself understood
how much his energy could do. He rejected the proposal,
but he had the desire to replace the ministers
themselves by a power more formidable and more direct.</p>

<p>In these days one disaster after another came to help
his scheme. More than one of his enemies had suspected
in a vague fashion that he was framing a new power,<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">[138]</a> but
they could not imagine in Danton anything higher than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_208"></a>[208]</span>
ambition, and they lent him the ridiculous project of
forcing a new ministry upon the Assembly. What he
was really preparing, and what he produced on the 10th
of March, was the weapon which history has called the
Revolutionary Tribunal.</p>

<p>It was the moment when the mutterings against the
Girondins seemed about to take the form of an insurrection,
when their printing presses were broken, and
when, in the vague panic that always followed any popular
movement since September, men feared a renewal of the
massacres. The proposal is put forward with ability of
argument rather than with passion; but, in the teeth of
the majority and a ministry to which such methods were
detestable, in the teeth, that is, of the Girondin idealism
which was ruining the country, he affirmed the necessity
of his scheme, and he passed it.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> He had given the
Revolutionary Government its first great weapon, a weapon
that was later to be turned against himself; his second
move was to put it into vigorous hands.</p>

<p>This next proposition, which, combined with the establishment
of the Revolutionary Tribunal, was to change
the history of France, did not proceed from Danton alone,
but it was based upon Danton’s suggestion; it sprang
largely from the vivid impression he had given of the
peril in which France lay and of the necessity of forming
something central and strong, of providing a hand which
could use the dictatorship of the Terror. The Committee
of Public Safety, in a word, could not have been declared
but for the interpretation which Danton had given to the
disasters of March.</p>

<p>The crowning defeat of Neerwinden, which at the
time must almost have seemed the death of the Republic,
gave the first impulse. The old Committee of General
Defence was renewed. But though this committee was
far too large and far too feeble, we owe it to Danton that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_209"></a>[209]</span>
it contained a vigorous minority from the Left. The
final blow that replaced it by an institution round which
the rest of this book will turn was the treason of
Dumouriez.</p>

<p>Let us consider what the situation was at this moment.
The Republic had lost every man upon whose ability she
could rely in the leadership of armies. Of all the school
of generals who had grown up under the old regime,
Lafayette alone in his weak way had loved freedom, and
Dumouriez alone had remained on the side of the French.
Spain, England, the German Powers—nine allies—were
threatening the territory of the Republic and the very
existence of the new regime; the civil war, which was
soon to take such gigantic proportions, had already made
its successful beginning at Machecoul. Between the
Convention and immediate disaster there lay only the
personality of Dumouriez. When the news of his desertion,
following on the news of his defeat, reached Paris,
the Girondins were hopelessly discredited, and the line of
their political retreat, the pursuit of their enemies, ran in
a direction that Danton’s speeches had prepared.</p>

<p>For several days he had himself been the object of
the most violent attacks, especially for his friendship with
Dumouriez and on the question of the Belgian accounts.
For he had just returned from a third mission to the
army, and had been close to the general. On the 1st
of April practically the whole sitting was devoted to an
attack upon him and to his defence. Had you been
sitting in the house that night, you would have said that
a violent demagogue, surrounded by a little group of yet
more violent friends, was resisting with some difficulty
the attacks of an honest and loyal majority. But this
demagogue was so far-seeing, was so much the greatest
of all those in the hall, that when three days afterwards
the Parliament was brought face to face with the reality,
Danton’s method becomes the only solution. They hear<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_210"></a>[210]</span>
of Dumouriez’ treason, and on the night of the 4th of
April, Isnard, himself a Girondin, proposed the creation of
the Committee. Danton supported him at midnight with
a definite speech such as no Girondin would have dared
to make. He said practically, “This Committee is precisely
what we want, a hand to grasp the weapon of the
Revolutionary Tribunal.”</p>

<p>It was Isnard that formulated the idea, but it was
Danton that baptised it “A Dictator.” It was at midnight
that he spoke, and he closed his short speech just on the
turn of the morning of the 5th of April. That very day a
year later the Dictator seized him, and his own Tribunal
put him to death.</p>

<p>On the 5th of April, the next day, in the evening, we
begin to get those large measures and rapid which came
with the new organ of power. And Danton speaks with
a kind of joy, and demands at once such measures as
only a dictatorship can produce—calling all the people to
the defence, fixing a maximum upon the price of bread,
even the first mention of a levée <i>en masse</i>. The air is
full of such a spirit as you get in an army, the certitude
that with discipline and unity and authority all things can
be done. On the following day, the 6th, the Committee
was chosen, and on the 7th the names were read out,
which showed that the power had finally passed from the
Girondins to those whom they had rejected at the moment
when France was forgiving everything for the sake of
Jemappes. The Convention, in need of men of action,
had been forced to abandon its own leaders and to turn
to Danton.</p>

<p>The names that they heard read out were Barrère,
Delmas, Bréard, Debry, Morvaux, Cambon, Treilhard, Lacroix,
and Danton.</p>

<span class="smaller">THE TERROR</span></h2>

</div>

<p>From the 6th April 1793, from the act which was described
at the end of the last chapter, we have something
new in the course of the Revolution. We have at last an
Institution.</p>

<p>It is in the nature of the French people (for reasons
which might to some extent be determined, but whose
discussion has no place in this book) that their history
should present itself in a peculiarly dramatic fashion.
Their adventures, their illusions, their violence, their despair,
their achievements, seem upon a hundred occasions
to centre round particular men or certain conspicuous
actions, in such a fashion that those men and these actions
fit themselves into a story, the plot and interest of which
absorb the reader. But if we attempt to connect the
whole into a series, even if we attempt to give the causes
or the meaning of a few years’ events, the dramatic aspect
fails. This quality, which has fascinated so many, has
also mistaught us and confused us, and, in the desire to
“throw the limelight” upon the centre of action, one
historian after another has left in obscurity that impersonal
blind force which directs the whole.</p>

<p>This force in France is the Institution. Understand
the character and methods of her central power, and you
find yourself possessed of this great key to the understanding
of her history, namely, that events follow each
other in the order that the Institution requires, and the
nation moves along the lines which the Institution determines.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_212"></a>[212]</span>
The Institution provides a standpoint from which
all falls into perspective, even the details of personality no
longer remain in confusion. You find, in a little while,
that you are dealing with an organism more simple and
of far greater vitality than any man, as truly a living, and
much more truly a permanent, force than a monarch or a
great minister can be.</p>

<p>The consideration of half-a-dozen examples will make
this clear. What is all that marvellously dramatic action
between Pepin le Bref and the coronation of Hugh but
confusion? It ceases to be so when we follow with Fustel
de Coulanges the transformation of the Imperial system.
You can make nothing of the tenth and eleventh centuries,
for all their personal interest, until you have grasped Feudalism,
and it is a common-place that the six hundred
years that follow are but the development of the Capetian
method. It is not in Louis the XI., or in Mazarin, or in
Louis XIV. that we find the Force—it is in the French
monarchy. Look about you at the present day, ask yourself
what has recreated the prosperity of modern France,
and you will certainly not be able to find a special man.
It is the System that has done the work.</p>

<p>Now it is the note of all the Revolution, as we have
followed it up to this point, that the Institution was lacking.
France without it was France without herself: she
dissolved. The cause of this lack was as follows: The
monarchy, round which everything had centred, was dying,
and the social theories of the time—the great Philosophy
on which France was fed—neglected and despised the
Institution, relying as it did upon the vague force of
general opinion. It was the chief—I had almost said the
only—fault of the Jeffersonians in America and the idealist
Republicans in France, that they could see neither the
necessity of formulæ nor the just power of systems. Nevertheless
it was the instinct which remained in the French
mind, the “sub-conscious” sense of what the Institution<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_213"></a>[213]</span>
was to France, that made half the violence of the time. I
do not mean that the speeches recognised this character
openly—on the contrary, the enmities and the divisions
seem to turn entirely upon personal hatreds; but I mean
that the underlying fear, unexpressed but real, was that
such and such a proposition would create a permanent
tendency, and that Girondin or Jacobin success meant the
deflection of the torrent into one or the other of two
divergent channels. Here in England, living under an
order which is well established and old, we wonder at the
intensity of passion which some abstract resolution could
arouse in the Convention. We should wonder no longer
were we to comprehend that in the extreme rapidity with
which all France was being remoulded, a few words agreed
upon, a mere principle, might add a quality to all the
future history of the nation.</p>

<p>Two men in the Revolutionary period rose higher
than the flood, Mirabeau and Danton. Each was able
to perceive what the permanent character of the nation
was, and each gave all his efforts to the uniting or welding
round some stable centre the new order to which
both were attached. In a word, each understood what
the Institution was to France, and desired to lend it
force and endurance. With Mirabeau it was the monarchy.
Would he have saved, recreated, and restored that declining
power which had once been the framework of the
nation? We cannot tell. Had he lived, ’92 would have
shown us; only we know that if the monarchy had
seemed to him at last beyond repair, he would have
proposed at once some similar power to replace it. Now
Danton had survived; doubtful in 1791, “more monarchist
than you, M. de Lafayette,” he was determined in 1792
that the crown and France were separate for ever. He
overthrew the palace, but from that very moment all his
policy was directed to the construction of a governing
power. It is here that he and the Girondins, for all his<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_214"></a>[214]</span>
personal attempts at unity, were hopelessly divided. The
Girondins were bent upon that local autonomy and that
extreme individual liberty in which the central power
disappears. With the growing danger, with his own
experience of Belgium, Danton, during the early part of
1793, becomes set upon the idea of government and of
nothing else. He gave it a weapon before it existed, for
he made the Revolutionary Tribunal, and though Isnard
first proposed it, it is known that Danton led the movement
which ended in the establishment of the Committee.</p>

<p>All government since that time in France has been
its heir. It was the Committee that forged the centralised
system, that showed how the administration might
radiate from Paris, that gave precedent for the conscription
and for all determined action. That dictatorship so
plainly saved the country in its worst peril that under
many different names the French people have often recalled
it, and rarely without success.</p>

<p>All the remaining year with which this chapter must
deal is the story of the Committee. The Committee
explains and gives us the clue to every action. Its
changes, the men who dominated it, the reasons it had
for violence or for clemency, its main object of throwing
back the invasions—these are the central part of 1793
and 1794.</p>

<p>Had we an accurate account of what passed in that
secret council, almost every event could be referred to it.
But such an account is lacking. Barrère, always inconsistent,
wrote a rigmarole in his old age which has
anecdotes of interest, but which is almost valueless for
our purpose. Here and there we have a disconnected
anecdote or a lame confession, but the doors of the room
are as closed to us as they were to the contemporaries
who stood in the outer hall and received the official
nothings of Barrère, or later of St. Just. Nevertheless<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_215"></a>[215]</span>
what we can reconstruct of its spirit and action, imperfect
as our effort may be, does more to explain the
time than any descriptions of the orators or of the
crowd.</p>

<p class="tb">The action of this new executive, as it touches Danton,
changes rapidly during the year. In the first Committee
of nine Danton is everything. He made it and he directs
it. Towards the close, however, of its short existence, he
is beginning to feel the pressure of the Jacobins, and of
Robespierre and of St. Just, the victory of the Mountain.
This loss of power on his part ends with the dissolution
of the old Committee, and when the new one is formed—with
the 10th of July—another period begins. The
members are increased to twelve; then enter the Robespierrians.
Danton, for motives which we shall discuss
later, resigns, and there are two doubtful summer months
when he still maintains, from without, the power of the
Committee, but first begins to check so far as is possible
the tyranny upon which it has embarked. He retires
in a kind of despair to Arcis, and with his return a new
phase is entered. The Committee is striking furiously;
the Terror has taken root; and by an action of generosity,
or perhaps of wisdom, Danton sets himself against his
own creation. These few months—the winter of 1793-1794—give
us that side of Danton which at the time was
least explicable, but which best defines him for posterity.
He puts his whole weight as an orator, and, through the
genius of his friends, he puts the journals also against the
Terror. Knowing (as he must have known) how strong
was the engine he had made, he yet withstands it, and
attempts by a purely personal force, without an organisation
and without executive power, to reduce the action
of the Committee. So great was he that for some weeks
his success hung in the balance. France, we must presume,
was with him. Paris doubted, but might have<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_216"></a>[216]</span>
been won. When the violent and unscrupulous Hébertists
were executed he seemed to have succeeded, and the
Terror appeared to be closed. But the Committee had
a deeper policy; in the same week that saw the fall of
Hébert, Danton was himself suddenly arrested with his
friends. How far Robespierre permitted and how far
directed the action will never be fully known. The
Committee struck the one great force opposed to it, and
the Dantonists were executed on the anniversary of its
creation.</p>

<p class="tb">The first part of the story of the Committee in its
relation to Danton is the period between April the 6th
and July the 10th 1793. It is the period of the fall of
the Girondins; and to make clear the importance of the
new power I shall adopt this method:—</p>

<p>To give first in their order the events that led to the
attack on the Parliament and the expulsion of the twenty-two;
to show in what confusion the whole story lies, and
how difficult (or impossible) it is to follow the motives
of the deputies, or to say why they acted as they did.
Then to give, as a parallel account, the position and
action of the Committee, and to show how fully (in my
opinion) its motive determines the history of the time;
to look at the insurrection of June 2 from the room
where the nine members debated in secret, and to point
out how, from that standpoint (which was Danton’s own),
the confusion falls into order.</p>

<p>First, then, what was the exterior history of the movement
that destroyed the Gironde? It will be remembered
that when the Convention first met in September,
the great majority of its numbers inclined to a certain
spirit. That spirit was best represented by a small group
of men, idealists and orators—and of these a number,
the most powerful perhaps, had come from the vineyards
of the peaceable southern river. The warmth, the calm,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_217"></a>[217]</span>
the fruitfulness of the Valley of the Gironde, appeared
in Vergniaud’s accents. To this devoted band of men,
whose whole career was justice and virtue, no one has
dared to be contemptuous, and history on every side has
left them heroes. They were own brothers to the immortal
group that framed the American Constitution,
the true heirs of Rousseau, and worthy to defend and
at last to give their lives for the Republican idea. They
hated the shedding of blood; they tested every action
by the purest standard of their creed; and from the first
speeches in which they demanded the war, to the day
when they sang the Marseillaise on the scaffold, they did
not swerve an inch from the path which they had set
before themselves.</p>

<p>What led such men into conflict with Paris, and perhaps
with France? This fault: that the pure theory which
they justly maintained to be the one right government
could not meet Europe in arms. What a few millions lost
on the littoral of the American continent could do, without
frontiers and without memories, that France could not
do with civil war raging, and with the world invading
her frontiers. A modification was imperative, a compromise
with necessary evil. The men who felt reality
knew that well. Danton had forced on a dictatorship,
and gave it the method of the Terror. But the Girondins,
though they had been compelled to give up so much, yet
refused to follow the necessary path. They refused the
conscription; a volunteer army was the only one tolerable
to free men. They refused diplomacy; it involved a secret
method, and was of its nature based on compromise.
They refused the requisitions to the armies, the forced
taxes, the hegemony of Paris, the preponderance of
talent or genius in the committees—in a word, they
refused to sanction anything, however necessary, in that
crisis, which they would not have sanctioned in a time
of order and of a pure republic.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_218"></a>[218]</span></p>

<p>The result of this sublime obstinacy was the ruin
of France and of themselves. The Royalists saw it, and
called themselves “Girondins;” the great name became
a label for every reaction, and in every new disaster Paris
saw with increasing clearness the restraining hand of the
Gironde. For it was Paris and its Commune that took
the leadership in the attempt to depose or expel the men
who led the Parliament. Already before the Committee
had been formed, the Commune on April the 2nd had
begun to correspond with the municipalities of France—the
fatal step that had so often preceded insurrection.
To Paris as a centre, to Paris radical, and especially to
Paris violent and unreasoning, the Girondins had grown
detestable. Paris for a thousand years had stood for unity—the
Girondins were autonomist and federal. Paris was
passionate—the Girondins as calm as light. To all this
enmity the Gironde answered by no force, but only by
an assertion of their inviolable right. All April and May
is consumed in the tale of great disasters without, and
of the acute battle between the Right and the deputation
from Paris within.</p>

<p>It is when we turn to this struggle within the Convention
that the confusion arises which can only be made
clear by considering the Committee. Especially is this
the case with regard to Danton’s action. Thus, on the
10th of April, he opposes the prosecution of those who
sent a petition from the Halle aux Blés for the resignation
of Roland; on the 13th there is the famous speech
in favour of diplomatic action as opposed to the violence
of the Mountain. Yet the day before he also opposed in a
formal and well-reasoned speech the arrest and trial of
Marat. When that madman, with whom his name had
been so often linked, came back in triumph from his
acquittal, Danton took a yet more inexplicable attitude.
While all the Mountain were shouting for joy, and while
Paris welcomed the verdict as the first wound of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_219"></a>[219]</span>
Gironde (which, indeed, it was), Danton merely said,
“Paris, we see, so loves the Convention as to applaud
the acquittal of one of its members”—a very transparent
speech. On the 1st of May Danton is the only
man to speak with sobriety and good sense against the
petition of the Faubourg St. Antoine, which attacked
the rights of property; yet on the 10th he turns against
Isnard, that is, against the Gironde and the Moderates,
and causes the proposal of what was practically a popular
referendum on the constitution to be rejected. We see,
therefore, even when we look at the action of Danton
alone, the apparent confusion that was indicated above.
Were we to turn to almost any other of the Committee
the same would be apparent. Barrère, the chief spokesman,
seems to take now one side, now the other. At one
moment he attacks the Girondins purposely; at another
the petitions from Paris; at every point, in the action
of every prominent speaker outside the two opposing
groups, there appears this inextricable tangle.</p>

<p>With the 10th of May the battle between Paris and
the Gironde entered into its last phase. It was upon this
date that the Convention began to sit permanently in
the little theatre of the Tuilleries, where they had first
met. The news that met them was the death of Dampierre
and the taking of Thouars by the Vendeans. Every
rumour of disaster (and the rumours were being confirmed
with fatal rapidity) was like oil spilt from the lamp of
the Gironde. Their own followers were shaken, the great
mass of the Convention who put their trust in these pure
doctrines grew afraid and doubtful. Within a week (on
the 17th) the Commune took a further step; they made
their own law, and put Boulanger at the head of the
armed force of the town—a force that was not theirs to
govern. Later they gave Henriot the place. The Convention
answered by electing Isnard their president; and
Guadet, the headstrong, proposed to break the Commune,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_220"></a>[220]</span>
and to call the “suppliants” to Bourges. By this proposal
a kind of Parliament in reserve would have existed
to take up the work if the Parliament in Paris should be
mutilated. Had the motion passed, the civil war, which
was muttering in Lyons and had broken into open flame
in Vendée, would have embraced all France.</p>

<p>But at this juncture Danton’s Committee comes in
again with its curiously mixed action. By the mouth of
Barrère it pleads against the motion, and proposes instead
the appointment of twelve members, as Girondin as they
pleased, to judge the Commune, to “inquire.” The commission
was named, and acted on thorough principle and
with haste, and without judgment, as any one might have
foretold; for such was the Girondin weakness. Against the
army that the Commune was gathering, all it could propose
was to double the sergeant’s guard at the Tuilleries,
while it exasperated its enemy by ordering the arrest of
Hébert.</p>

<p>Hébert was the one man in the Revolution of whom
the truth has certainly been told by enemies. There was
something of the pickpocket in Hébert, but not of the
pickpocket only. He was also a blasphemer, an atheist,
a man delighting in the foulest words, and in the most
cowardly or ferocious of actions. His prominence was
due to two things. First, he was the pamphleteer of the
time, the “Père Duchesne.” France had not yet discovered
the danger of a free press. Secondly, in the
Parisian exasperation against “the Moderates,” the most
extreme and the least rational became of necessity a
kind of symbol, an accentuated type, and was thrust
forward as a defiance. It is not too much to say that
the Girondins themselves, by their lack of all measure,
pushed Hébert to the front.</p>

<p>Such measures as those which “the twelve” had
decreed were but fuel for the insurrectionary flame.
Once more Danton appears, this time against the Gironde.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_221"></a>[221]</span>
To the demand for a large guard drawn from the Departments
he said, “You are decreeing that you are afraid!”
Whereupon a voice from the right cried with some humour,
“I am.” Danton had his way, the guard was not formed,
and on the following day (the 25th of May) Isnard’s
imprudence brought on the catastrophe.</p>

<p>It was in the matter of the petition for the release of
Hébert. Isnard rose in the chair, lifted his hand, and pronounced
in his hollow voice the words that have enriched
history at the expense of his country: “If such a thing
should happen as an attempt upon the representatives of
the nation, I say to you, in the name of all France, that
very soon men would search upon the banks of the Seine
for proofs that Paris had once been there.” Danton
intervened, but he could do nothing. The glove had
been thrown down. He asked for the withdrawal of
those words; the Girondin majority reaffirmed them.
Two days later he obtained the freedom of Hébert; but
though for a moment he was promised the dissolution of
the “Commission of the Twelve,” his effort failed, for
they were immediately reinstated. In the night between
the 30th and the 31st of May the Sections named a new
and insurrectionary Commune; for one day the danger
was warded off, and you may see Danton, still so difficult
to understand, urging the Committee, while Barrère is proposing
the conciliatory message to France, a document
which blamed neither the Girondins nor Paris, and the
twelve were dissolved. But the final blow was not to
be avoided. On the 2nd of June the news of the counter-revolution
in Lyons reached Paris. The Convention was
surrounded; Henriot, at the head of the city militia,
guarded its approaches, lined the corridors. Even in
that moment, when Isnard proposed to retire, and made
his superb apology, the Gironde, as a whole, stood firm.
The inflexible Jansenist, Lanjuinais, proposed, with heroic
folly, “a decree dissolving the authorities of Paris,” at a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_222"></a>[222]</span>
moment when these very authorities were holding the
doors with fixed bayonets; but in spite of Barrère’s demand
for Henriot’s condemnation, in spite of Danton’s
demand for “a signal punishment,” the Convention
yielded, voted the arrest not only of the twenty-two,
whom the Commune had demanded, but of twenty-nine,
and Vergniaud, Barbaroux, Guadet; Le Brun, and Clavière
(who were nominally ministers); Roland (who had fled,
and whose wife was imprisoned by the Commune)—in
fine, the whole body of those great orators who had made
the Republic—were thrust out of the Assembly, some to
be held in the honourable confinement of their own
houses, some to fly and raise civil war in the Departments.
The Commune offered hostages in equal number,
but they were refused; and before the day was over the
Parliament was mutilated, and the obstacle to the dictatorship
and to the Terror had been swept away.</p>

<p>Such is a rapid summary of the fall of the Girondins—a
story of contradictions and of inextricable cross-purposes,
in which for two months men seem (especially
the men of the new Committee) to change sides, to
hesitate, and to falter, in which the majority passes over
to the Jacobins with a startling rapidity, and in which
(apparently) the only two fixed points are the immovable
figures of the Gironde and their opponents of the
Commune.</p>

<p>I know that this confusion has commonly led writers
to adopt an equal confusion in their explanation of the
insurrection and of its motives. To disentangle such a
skein it was apparently necessary to make Robespierre a
prophet, Isnard for once a coward, Barrère a skilful diplomatist,
Danton a vacillator. Such a method appears to
me false. If, to explain a difficult passage in history, we
make men behave in a way which contradicts all their
lives, we must (it seems to me) be in error. These special
theories are mechanical, and do not satisfy the mind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_223"></a>[223]</span></p>

<p>The question is this: Somewhere a power existed;
why was not that power in evidence either on one side
or on the other? And why do we not see it acting? I
believe the answer is as follows:—</p>

<p>The power was in the Committee. The Committee
believed it necessary to be rid of the Girondins.
But the Committee was part of the Convention—the
existence and the authority of the Convention was necessary
to it. It saw on the one hand a set of Parliamentary
leaders who would not permit it to act with vigour, on the
other it noted the angry spirit of Paris. The Committee
permitted that spirit to act, but gave it its measure and
its direction unknown to itself, desiring to eliminate the
Moderates, but anxious to avoid their proscription, exile, or
death. With this clue the maze seems to me resolved.
It was the Committee that expelled the Gironde, using
Paris for its arm.</p>

<p>Now to prove this certain steps are necessary. In
the first place, why can we say that the Committee was
the centre of power? Because it alone had access to a
complete knowledge of France, it alone debated in secret,
and it alone existed for the express purpose of dictatorship.
When once the generals, the deputies in mission,
and the police became familiar with the new organ, they
referred to the Committee as naturally as the corresponding
men to-day would refer to a cabinet or to a monarch.
If the reader will glance at any portion of the document
which is printed as <a href="#APPENDIX_XI">Appendix XI.</a> of this book, and to which
I shall continually refer in this passage, he will at once
perceive that the men who drew it up had in their hands
every lever of public machinery. I would not maintain
that this power sprang at once into existence on the 6th
of April, but the two months that produced such a report
was ample time to have developed a corresponding grasp
upon the armies, upon the diplomacy, and upon the
internal resources of Revolutionary France. Where else<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_224"></a>[224]</span>
will you find such a document in all the offices of the
time? Compared with it the decisions of the ministry
are vague abstractions, the reports of the Commune
puerilities or ravings. Revolutionary France, until the
formation of the Committee, may be compared to a marsh
in which the water tends to flow to no one centre; the
information, the revenue, the public forces stood incoherent
and stagnant. The creation of this secret body may be
compared to a pit dug in its centre, to which the waters
would immediately flow. It may be objected that they
had not the control of finance. No; but they had
Cambon. In an assembly of men new to government
this very difficult province fell of itself into the hands of
a man whose genius all admitted, and whose probity
no one of his enemies would deny. Long before the
insurrection took place, any man with information, with
authority, or with a special duty to perform, had learnt
to regard the Committee as his chief, for the simple reason
that no other centre of authority existed. Add to this
the incalculable force of secrecy, the power by which the
most glaring failures of our cabinets can be hidden by
merely saying, “We know what all the rest ignore,” and
it will appear reasonable to say that by June the Committee
could almost, had it wished, have summoned an
army to Paris. The Committee then held the power.</p>

<p>In the second place, we must establish, as far as is
possible, the aims of the Committee and their method of
guiding the insurrection. As was said earlier in this
chapter, those aims and methods can only be arrived at
by inference; the very nature of a body that deliberates
in secret makes this method of inquiry necessary. There
is no direct evidence, unless the contradictory anecdotes
of a much later period can be given that name. Now
we can infer with some accuracy what went on in their
deliberations. There should be noted at the outset the
document to which I have already referred, and which, if<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_225"></a>[225]</span>
I am not mistaken, is printed for the first time in this
book. It was the first of those general Rapports which were
delivered by Barrère to the Convention for the next sixteen
months, and which so profoundly affected the course
of the Revolution. It sums up the result of two months
of astonishing labour; everything—all the weakness of
France—has been noted with the accuracy of a topographical
survey. It gives the equipment, the provisioning,
the local difficulties of each army, the detailed
condition of the fleet (a most deplorable picture), the
result of what is evidently an elaborate spy-system in the
department of foreign intrigue, and everywhere the indictment
is obvious—“whatever has governed France hitherto
has hopelessly failed.” There are, indeed, polite references
to the ineptitude of the old regime, but side by
side with these there is a direct attack on the Girondin
Ministers of War, and on the diplomatic, or rather non-diplomatic,
methods which had been pursued abroad;
indeed, many parts of this report would not be out of
place had they appeared in a Compte Rendu drawn up
by the victorious insurrection, instead of preceding, as
they did, the fall of the Gironde.</p>

<p>Again, there is the date of its appearance. It was
not by a coincidence that Barrère was given it to read on
the 29th of May. Note this sequence. Isnard made
his fatal speech on Saturday the 25th. Monday the
27th was the date of Danton’s attempt to dissolve “the
twelve;” and his failure followed on Tuesday the 28th,
when, by the blindness or firmness of the Gironde, they
were reinstated. It is on Wednesday the 29th that
Barrère rises at the end of a long and stormy discussion,
and, late in the afternoon, presents his report. The vague
phrases on the importance of unity which it contains have
made some imagine that it was an attempt at conciliation,
rapidly devised and thrown out at that critical moment.
That opinion is surely erroneous. It is long (some 17,000<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_226"></a>[226]</span>
words) and carefully prepared; it must have taken some
time to draw up, and it has all the appearance of a
weapon framed at leisure and held in reserve; it comes
at that moment with some such force as this, saying
from the Committee, from Danton, to the Gironde—“You
have refused to do what France absolutely needed. You
have rejected my attempts to save you, the avenues
which I opened for your escape; you were given the
commission of twelve; you have fatally abused the gift.
Will you be convinced at the last moment by this
picture of the terrible straits to which you have brought
the nation?”</p>

<p>Finally, we can draw a fairly conclusive set of proofs
from our knowledge of the men in the Committee and
of the public action they took. Of all the nine, Danton
was the one commanding personality. Cambon was a
specialist, and but for him and Lindet, honest but not an
orator, there were Danton and his men only. Barrère,
it may be urged, was not a Dantonist; but he was
pliant to a degree; his pliancy is notorious, and has
ignorantly been given a still worse name. Moreover,
Barrère was closeted with Danton day after day; they
undertook the same department in the Committee (that
of foreign affairs), and they follow exactly the same
course in the tribune. In the Department of War was
Delacroix, Danton’s friend and right hand. Of the report
itself, all the last part, and possibly some paragraphs in
the middle, were drawn up by Danton. Later we shall
see that his preponderance was notorious and a danger
to him.</p>

<p>Well, Danton and the Committee being so nearly
identical, can we make a description of the motive that
urged him? I think we can. Desmoulin’s “Histoire des
Brissottins” was certainly not of Danton’s inspiration.
Camille wrote that deadly pamphlet under the eye of
Robespierre. But Fabre d’Eglantine at the Jacobins, on<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_227"></a>[227]</span>
May the 1st, calling on the Girondins “to go, and return
when all is settled,” is almost using Danton’s own phrase—“Qu’ils
s’en aillent, et qu’ils revennent profiter de notre
victoire.” All that he and Barrère say, from then to the
day of June the 2nd, seems to fall under this formula. He
permits the attack of the Commune, while he does everything
to moderate its force. He speaks continually for
the defence, but he and his Committee refuse to act, and
if ever he has spoken a little too strongly, has given the
Girondins a little too much power, he retreats somewhat
towards the Commune. He resembles a man who is
opening a sluice in a dyke of the fen country: behind
him is the sea; he admits and plays with its power, but
unless his calculation is just it may rush in and overwhelm
him. He permitted Paris to strike, and he created
a tyranny; both the mob of the capital and the dictatorship
were destined to break from his hands.</p>

<p>These are, as I read them, the causes of the fall of
the Girondins. I have dealt with them at this length
because the passage from the 31st of May to the 2nd of
June 1793 is not only one of the most fiercely debated,
but also one of the most important in the history of the
Revolution. I have not given it too much space, for upon
the understanding of what led to and what permitted the
insurrection depends, without any question, our final judgment
on Danton’s position.</p>

<p>Here, then, the Committee, even in its infancy,
furnishes the clue to a difficult passage in the Revolution.
It is becoming more and more necessary as research progresses
to refer the mysteries of the period to that central
body; and, as it seems to me, we have in its first general
report the first explanation of that most complex movement,
the insurrection of the 2nd of June.</p>

<p>The Gironde having disappeared, there was left before
Danton a task of extreme difficulty. He was about to
attempt the management of men whom he deliberately<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_228"></a>[228]</span>
permitted to engage in battle. It is of the very first
importance in our study of his career to appreciate the
conditions of this task. Consider for a moment what he
has done. He has by arguments, by threats, and finally
by the use of the mob, made the Revolutionary Government
a reality. It is in this last ally that we find the
cause of his future failure. Hitherto he has been battling
with particular men, preventing a small group of politicians
from obstructing the Revolutionary measures, cajoling
on the other hand the extreme members of the Convention
by calculated outbursts of sympathy. Such a task no
one would find impossible, did he possess at once a clear
object and the genius to approach it. But after the 2nd
of June it was another matter. He had let loose the
storm, and with the pride of a man who felt his strength
inwards and outwards (for scheming and for haranguing),
he had determined deliberately to ride it. It was a miscalculation.
Something resembling a natural force, something
like an earthquake or a lava stream, opposed itself
to his mere individual will; and Danton, who among the
politicians had been like a man among boys, became in
the presence of these new forces like a lonely traveller
struggling at evening against a growing tempest in the
mountains. From this moment we shall see him using
in vain against the passions of 1793 the ability, the ruse,
the eloquence, the energy which had so long succeeded
among the statesmen. They will be swept down like
driftwood upon the current of popular madness which he
himself has let loose. The Committee will be formed of
new members, the Terror will grow from day to day, the
Revolution will begin to take on that character of fanaticism
which was directly opposed to Danton’s plan, and he
will retire disappointed and beaten. He will return
frankly out of sympathy with the excesses, and in expiation
of that fault of sanity he will die.</p>

<p>The months in which he fights this losing battle are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_229"></a>[229]</span>
the hot months of 1793. I will not deny that during
this summer his name is more conspicuous than at any
period of his life. I will admit that if we deal with
history as a spectacle, the climax of 1793 should be distinguished
by his voice and presence. But it is this
fascination of the picturesque which has made his life
inexplicable, and a biographer dares not leave it so.
Although June, July, and August are full of his speeches,
his warning, and even his energy, yet I say that he
was day after day losing his hold and slipping. He
is conspicuous because in the face of such disaster he
redoubled his energy; but even that redoubled energy is
dwarfed in the face of the spirit that animated the Terror.</p>

<p>First with regard to June: it was still a period of
hope, and he still thought himself the master. He had
added to the Committee, not thinking them dangerous,
but as a kind of sop, five members of the Mountain.
Among them were two who were to prove the ruin of his
whole system—Couthon and St. Just. Perhaps to temper
their action, perhaps merely because he was a friend,
he included Hérault de Séchelles. The names were
typical of what was to happen in 1794, when, by the
power of St. Just, Hérault was to be thrust out of the
Committee and sent to die with Danton himself.</p>

<p>Unconscious of what this addition would lead to, unconscious
also of what echoes the 2nd of June might
arouse in the provinces, Danton pursued his path as
though the insurrection had been but one event of many.
The minister Le Brun was brought by his guards day
after day to aid in the discussions, and taken back to the
custody of his own house. One might have thought that
the “moral insurrection” of which Robespierre had talked
had led only to a “moral suppression” of the Girondins.
Moreover, the whole of these days of June are full of
Danton’s yet remaining supremacy. He goes on with his
two principal methods, namely, a strong secret government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_230"></a>[230]</span>
and moderation in the application of its tyranny,
as though the situation was his to mould at his will.
Thus, on the 8th, he says with regard to the decree
against foreigners: “I will show you such and such an
alien established in France who is much more of a patriot
than many Frenchmen. I say to you, therefore, that
while the principle of watching foreigners is good, you
should send this proposal to the Committee and let it be
discussed there.” Again, two days later, he refuses to
admit the violent attitude of the Mountain towards Bordeaux.
He even praises that city at a time when it was
practically in rebellion, to defend its proscribed members.
Within the same week he continues to talk of La Vendée
as the only centre of insurrection. He continues to be
the Danton of old, although the Girondins are raising the
standard of civil war on every side, and he maintains that
continuous effort and compromise which had saved so much
in the autumn of 1792, and which could do so little now.</p>

<p>Within the Committee they framed the Constitution
of 1793—that great monument of democracy, which
never took its place in history, nor ever affected the lives
of men. It stands like an idol of great beauty which
travellers find in a desert place; its religion has disappeared
from the earth; no ruins surround it; in the day
when it was put up the men who raised it were driven
from what should have been the centre of their adoration.
That Danton was still in power when the result was debated
in the Parliament during the third week of the
month is evident from two things: first, that the Constitution,
with its broad guarantees of individual liberty and
of local autonomy, with its liberal spirit, so nearly approaching
the great dream of Condorcet, so opposed to
the narrow fanaticism of the Jacobins, was definitely
intended to appease the growing passions of civil war.
Two-thirds of France, of the country-sides at least, was
arming because Paris had dared to touch the representatives<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_231"></a>[231]</span>
of the nation. The Constitution was thrown like
a hostage; the men who saw the necessity for a dictatorship
said virtually, “The violence that offends you is only
for a moment. Here is what we desire with the return
of peace.” And the document so responded to the heart
of France that it succeeded.</p>

<p>The second proof that Danton had still hold of the
reins is to be found in this: that the advice which he
gives during the discussions on the Constitution is not
that of violence, nor of flattery, but of moderate common-sense;
and of such advice which the Convention accepts
the best example is to be found in the speech on the
power of making war. It was a difficult thing to
convince the Assembly, in those days of abstractions,
that the nation, as a whole, could not exercise such
a right without hopeless confusion. Yet Danton had his
way. This month of June, then, which was so full of
terrible internal danger, during which Buzot had raised
a Girondin army sixty miles from Paris, during which
Normandy was in full revolt, during which Lyons had
attacked the Republic, and during which the counter-Revolution
seemed on the point of breaking out—this
month was still Danton’s own. He was secure in his
public position, for the very conquerors of the 2nd of
June, the violent extremists, could not prevent him from
exercising his diplomacy abroad and his pacificatory
compromise in domestic affairs.</p>

<p>He was also secure in that which mattered so much
more to him—I mean in his home. His mind had
sufficiently steadied after the shock that had maddened
him in February for him to follow the advice which
his dead wife had left him. On the 17th of June he
re-married. The woman was not suited to Danton. She
did not love him, nor probably did he love her. There
were two young children, whom, in the winter, his first
wife, finding herself to be dying, felt she was leaving<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_232"></a>[232]</span>
orphans. The eldest was only three years old. This
good woman, Catholic and devout, knowing her husband,
and the sheer necessity for a home which his character
had shown, determined on a religious education for her
sons, and determined on a Catholic woman to be about
her husband. She urged him to marry her younger friend,
Mdlle. Gély. An incident, which is doubtful, but which,
on the whole, I accept, does not seem to me to prove
the violence of an uncontrolled affection, but, on the
contrary, to show a kind of indifference, as though
Danton said to himself, “The thing must be done, and
had better be done so as to offend the family as little as
possible.” I mean the story of his marriage before a
non-juring priest. At any rate, that marriage shows an
element of determination and security. He was still
master of his fortunes and of himself.</p>

<p>But he had called up a spirit too strong for him.
July was to prove it.</p>

<p>June, which had seen the rise of the Girondin insurrection,
had also seen its partial appeasement and
suppression. It was, as we have said, the Constitution,
hurriedly improvised for this purpose, that had been the
main cause of such a success, but there remained for
July, more dangerous than ever, the foreign invasion and
the three outstanding strongholds of the civil war—Lyons,
Toulon, and La Vendée. It was against them
and their growing success, against the rebels and the
invaders, that the Terror was serviceable, and it was on
account of their continual progress that the Terror
assumed such fearful proportions.</p>

<p>I said earlier in this chapter that Danton inaugurating
and strengthening the dictatorship of the Revolutionary
Government was like a man deliberately opening a sluice
behind which was the whole sea. There was an element
of uncertainty upon the chances of which he had staked
the success of his effort, and, with the reverses, he soon<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_233"></a>[233]</span>
discovered that the forces which he had let loose were
going beyond him. It may be that he thought the
results of the 2nd of June would be more immediate
than they were. As a fact, it took many months to
recover the position which the supineness of the Girondins
had lost. In those months the Revolutionary Government
crystallised, as it were, became permanent, and fell
into the hands of the extremists.</p>

<p>On the very day that the Norman insurrection was
crushed at Vernon, a Norman girl stabbed Marat. It is
not within the scope of this book to deal at any great
length with the fate of the man whom Danton had called
“l’individu.” That most striking and picturesque episode
concerns us only in this matter, that it was a powerful
impetus to the system of the Terror, and such an one
as Danton, with all his judgment, could not possibly have
foreseen. Moreover, on the very day that Marat was
killed, the allied forces entered Warsaw, and there can
be no doubt that the success of this infamy gave them
a freer hand morally, at least upon the French frontier.
Mayence fell, and its fall cost the life of Josephine’s first
husband. The Allies had crossed the Rhine. Five days
later, on the 28th of July, Valenciennes fell. At the same
moment the Spaniards were pouring in east and west
of the Pyrenees, and the Piedmontese had crossed the
Alps. From a little press in Newcastle (the family
of the printer yet remain to tell the tale), Pitt was
drawing the thousands of forged assignats to ruin the
Republic. Five foreign armies were occupying the territory
of France, and late in the following month the
Spanish and English fleets were admitted to the harbour
and arsenal of Toulon. Let it then be granted that, with
the possible exception of the Roman power after Cannæ,
no power in history was ever so near destruction as was
Revolutionary France in that summer.</p>

<p>Let us see how the misfortunes of the country<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_234"></a>[234]</span>
reacted upon the position of Danton. Already, with early
July, he felt himself pressed and constrained by the
growing power of the Jacobin doctrine and of its high
priest. His system of conciliation, his attempts (in large
part successful) to coax rather than to defeat the insurrection,
were violently criticised in the debate of the 4th.
The anger against the Girondins, which the death of
Marat was to increase to so violent a degree, produced
the report of St. Just upon the 8th of July, which, though
history has called it moderate, yet mentions the accusation
of Vergniaud and of Gaudet, and to this Danton was
forced reluctantly to put his name. Two days afterwards
the old Committee to which he had belonged was dissolved
and a new one was elected.</p>

<p>It would be an error to regard this as a mere resignation
on the part of Danton; it would be equally an
error to regard it as a violent censure on the part of the
Convention. It is certain that he chose to withdraw
because the fatal necessity of things was giving power to
men of whom he had no opinion. Thus Robespierre
joined the Committee on the 27th of July—Robespierre,
of whom Danton could say in private, “The man has not
wits enough to cook an egg.” Yet this was the man who
was so worshipped by the crowd, that, once within the
Committee, he was destined to become the master of
France. It may be remarked in passing that something
fatal seemed to attach to the date on which a man
entered and began to lead the Committee. On the day
that Danton entered in ’93, on that day was he guillotined
in ’94. On the day that Robespierre entered in ’93, on
that day in ’94 he fell.</p>

<p>Danton remained, for a little longer than a month,
more and more separate from the management of affairs,
more and more out of sympathy with the men who
were conducting the government. Nevertheless, he stands
almost as an adviser and certainly with pure disinterestedness<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_235"></a>[235]</span>
throughout the month of August. He was alone.
Desmoulins was more with Robespierre than with him
at that moment. Westermann, his great friend and ally
on the 10th of August 1792, was under censure for his
defeat in Vendée. But standing thus untrammelled,
Danton for the moment appears with an especial brilliancy.
Indeed there is no act of his public life so clear, so
typical of his method, or so successful as his great speech
on the 1st of August. It was as though, divorced from
the pre-occupations of political intrigue and free from
the responsibility of executive power, he was able for the
first time in his whole life to speak his mind fully and
clearly. The speech is a précis, as it were, of all his
pronouncements on the necessity for a dictatorship and
the methods it should employ. It turns round this
sentence, “I demand that the Committee of Public
Safety should be erected into a Provisional Government.”
He said openly that while he asked for absolute powers
for the Committee, he refused ever to join it again. He
pointed out to them the necessity of uniting all power
in the hands of one body, of making a unique command
for a nation at war. To men who had been lost for so
long in the discussion of constitutional checks and guarantees,
he talked of the necessities as a general would
to his staff. If you will read this speech through, you
will find it to be the clearest exposition in existence of
the causes and of the methods of the action of France
in all her dangers from that day to our own. This speech,
which is the climax of his career, and which stands at
the fountain-head of so much in the modern nation, was
followed throughout the month by many a piece of
practical and detailed advice. He talks always quietly,
and always with a specific object in view, on the educational
proposals, on the great conscription (14th of
August), on the enforcement of an absolute military
discipline (15th of August), and so forth. But while<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_236"></a>[236]</span>
he is still in this position, of which the brilliancy and
success have deceived some into thinking that it was
the centre of his career, two things were at work which
were to lead to the strange crisis in which he lost his
life. First, the Terror was beginning to be used for purposes
other than those of the National Defence. Secondly,
there was coming upon him lethargy and illness. He
seems to have remained for a whole month, from the
middle of September till the middle of October, without
debating. There had come a sudden necessity for repose
into his life, and until it was satisfied he gave an impression
of weakness and of breaking down.</p>

<p>This was emphasised by a kind of despair, as he saw
the diplomatic methods abandoned in dealing with foreign
nations and the personal aims of the mystics, the private
vengeance of the bloodthirsty, or the ravings of the rank
madmen capturing the absolute system which he had
designed and forged at the expense of his titanic powers.
It was during this period that Garat saw him, and has
left us the picture of his great body bowed by illness,
and his small deep eyes filled with tears, as he spoke
of the fate that was following the Girondins, and of
how he could not save them. It was then also that,
walking slowly with Desmoulins at sunset by the Seine,
he said with a shudder that had never taken him before,
“The river is running blood.”</p>

<p>With October the Terror weighed on all France by
the decree of the month before. The suspects were
arrested right and left, and the country had entered into
one of those periods which blacken history and leave
gaps which many men dare not bridge by reading. He
broke down and fled for quiet to his native place. From
thence the Great Mother, of whom in all the Revolution
he had been the truest son, sent him back to fulfil the
mercy and the sanity of Nature as he had up till then
fulfilled her energies.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_237"></a>[237]</span></p>

<p>This book is the life of a man, and a man is his
mind. Danton, who has left no memoirs, no letters even—of
whose life we know so little outside the field of
politics—can only be interpreted, like any other man, by
the mind. We must seek the origin, though we have
but a phrase or two to guide us. What was that meditation
at Arcis out of which proceeded the forlorn hope
of the “Vieux Cordelier” and of the “Committee of
Indulgence”?</p>

<p>He was ill already; the great energies which had been
poured out recklessly in a torrent had suddenly run dry.
Garat saw him weak, uncertain, refusing to leave his
study, troubled in the eyes. The reins were out of his
hands; all that he thought, or rather knew, to be fatal to
the Republic was succeeding, and every just conception,
all balance, was in danger. This, though it was not the
cause of his weariness, coincided with it, and made his
sadness take on something of despair. There had always
been in his spirit a recurrent desire for the fields and
rivers; it is common to all those whom Nature has blessed
with her supreme gift of energy. He had at this moment
a hunger for his native place, for the Champagne after
the harvest, and for the autumn mists upon the Aube.
It was in this attitude, weary, despairing, ill, and needing
the country as a parched man needs water, that he asked
and obtained permission to leave the Convention. It
was upon the 12th of October, just as the worst phase of
the Terror was beginning, that he left the violence and
noise of the city and turned his face eastward to the cool
valley of the Marne.</p>

<p>Starting from this point, his weariness and his longing
for home, we can trace the movement of his mind during
the six weeks of his repose. He recovered health with
the rapidity that so often characterises men of his stamp;
he found about him the peaceable affection, the cessation
of argument and of self-defence which his soul had not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_238"></a>[238]</span>
known since the first days of 1789. His old mother
was with him, and his children also, the memories of his
own childhood. The place refreshed him like sleep; he
became again the active and merry companion of four
years before, sitting long at his meals, laughing with his
friends. The window of the ground-floor room opened
on to the Grande Place, and there are still stories of him
in Arcis making that window a kind of little rendezvous
for men passing and repassing whom he knew, his chatting
and his questions, his interests on every point except that
political turmoil in which the giant had worn himself out.
The garden was a great care of his, and he was concerned
for the farm in which he had invested the reimbursement
of his pre-revolutionary office. He delighted to meet his
father’s old friends, the mayor, the functionaries of the
place. This man, whom we find so typical of his fellow-countrymen,
is never more French than in his home.
The little provincial town, the <i>amour du clocher</i>, the prospect
of retirement in the province where one was born—the
whole scene is one that repeats itself upon every
side to-day in the class from which Danton sprang.</p>

<p>Moreover, as quiet took back its old place in his soul,
he saw, no longer troubled, but with calmness and certainty,
the course that lay before the Republic. The
necessity of restraint, which had irritated and pursued
him in his days of fever in Paris, was growing into a
settled and deliberate policy; he began to study the position
of France like a map; no noise nor calumny was
present to confuse him, and his method of action on
his return developed itself with the clearness that had
marked his first attitude in the elections of Paris. How
rapidly his mind was working even his friends could not
tell. One of them thought to bring him good news, and
told him of the death of the Girondins. Danton was in
his garden talking of local affairs, and when this was told
him, the vague reputation which he bore, the “terrible<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_239"></a>[239]</span>
Danton,” and the fear he had inspired, led them to
expect some praise. He turned as though he had been
stabbed, and cried sharply, “Say nothing. Do you call
that good news? It is a terrible misfortune.... It
menaces us all.” And no one understood what was passing
in his mind. It was the note that Garat had heard,
and later Desmoulins: “I did my best to save them; I
wish to God I could have saved them!”</p>

<p>Whatever other news reached Arcis in those terrible
months served only to confirm him more strongly in his
new attitude. Had he been tinged in the slightest
degree with the mysticism that was common to so many
in that time he would have felt a mission. But he was
a Champenois, the very opposite of a mystic, and he only
saw a task, a thing to be planned and executed by the
reason. Perhaps if he had had more of the exaltation of
the men he was about to oppose he might have succeeded.</p>

<p>It was upon the 21st of November that he returned
to Paris. His health had come back, his full vigour, and
with the first days of his reappearance in politics the
demand for which the whole nation was waiting is heard.
And what had not the fanatics done during the weeks of
his silence! Lyons, the Queen, the Girondins, Roland’s
wife—the very terms of politics had run mad, and he
returned to wrestle with furies.</p>

<p>Let me describe the confusion of parties through
which Danton had to wade in his progress towards the
re-establishment of liberty and of order. As for the
Convention itself, nominally the master, it was practically
of no power. It chose to follow now one now another
tendency or man; to be influenced by fear at this
moment, by policy at that, and continually by the Revolutionary
formulæ. In a word, it was led. Like every
large assembly, it lacked initiative. Above it and struggling
for power were these: First, the committees, that of
Public Safety, and its servant, that of General Security—the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_240"></a>[240]</span>
Government and the police. It was Danton, as we
know, who desired to make the committees supreme, who
had raised them as the institution, the central government.
But by this time they were a despotism beyond
the reach of the checks which Danton had always desired.
To save so mighty an engine from the dangers of ambition,
he had resigned in July. His sacrifice or lethargy
did not suffice. The Committee which had once been
Danton was now the Triumvirate—Robespierre, Couthon,
St. Just. It pursued their personal objects, it maintained
by the Terror their personal creed. Still Danton did not
desire to destroy it as a system. He wished to modify
its methods and to change its personnel, to let it merge
gradually into the peaceable and orderly government for
which the Revolution and the Republic had been made.
By a strange necessity, the workers, the men who were
most like Danton in spirit, the practical organisers on the
Committee, such as Carnot, Prieur, and Lindet, could not
help defending it in every particular. They knew the
necessity of staying at their post, and they feared, with
some justice, that if the Robespierrian faction was eliminated
their work might be suddenly checked. It was
because they were practical and short-sighted that they
were opposed to the practical but far-sighted policy of
Danton. They feared that with the cessation of the
Terror the armies would lack recruits, the commissariat
provisions, the treasury its taxes.</p>

<p>Against the Committee was the Commune. Hébert
at its worst; Clootz at its most ideal; Pache at its most
honest. This singular body represented a spirit very
close indeed to anarchy. It preached atheism as a kind
of dogma; it was intolerant of everything; it was as mad
as Clootz, as filthy as Hébert. It possessed a curious
mixture of two rages—the rage for the unity and defence
of France, the rage for the autonomy of Paris. In the
apathy that had taken the voters this small and insane<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_241"></a>[241]</span>
group held command of the city. But the Committees
were not what the Girondins had been. You could not
bully or proscribe Carnot, St. Just, Cambon, Jean Bon.
With the fatal pressure of the stronger wrestler the Committee
was pressing the Commune down. The Terror
remained in either case. But with the Committee supreme
it was a Terror of system striking to maintain a tyranny,
a pure despotism working for definite ends. Had the
Commune succeeded, it would have meant the Terror
run mad, the guillotine killing for the sake of killing—and
for ever.</p>

<p>The third party in the struggle was Robespierre. He
also desired the Terror, but he intended to use it, as he
did every power in France, towards a definite end—a certain
perfect state, of which he had received a revelation,
and of which he was the prophet. Of his aims and character
I shall treat when I come to his action after the fall
of Danton. It suffices to point out here that of the three
forces at work Robespierre alone had personality to aid him.
He had a guard, a group of defenders. They were inside,
and led the Committee itself; they were the mystics in a
moment of strong exaltation, and unreal as was the dream
of their chief, the Robespierrians were bound to succeed
unless the force of the real, the “cold water” that came
with Danton’s return, should destroy their hopes. Therefore,
as a fact, though no one, though Danton himself, did
not see it, it was between him and Robespierre that the
battle would ultimately be fought out.</p>

<p>For what was Danton’s plan? He put into his new
task the ability, the ruse, the suppleness that he had only
lost for a moment in the summer. First, Hébert and the
“enragés” must go—they were the vilest form of the
spirit that he perceived to be destroying the Republic.
Then the Committee must be very gradually weakened.
In that task he hoped, vainly enough, to make Robespierre
his ally. And finally, the end of all his scheme was the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_242"></a>[242]</span>
cessation of the Terror. He had created a dictatorship
for a specific purpose; that purpose was attained. Wattignies
had been won, Lyons captured; soon La Vendée
was to be destroyed, and even Toulon to fall. It was intolerable
that a system abnormal and extreme, designed
to save the State, should be continued for the profit of a
few theorists or of a few madmen. How much had not
his engine already done?—this machine which, to the
horror of its creator, had found a life of its own! It had
killed the Queen after a shocking trial; it had alienated
what was left of European sympathy; it had struck the
Girondins, and Danton was haunted by the inspired voice
of Vergniaud singing the “Marseillaise” upon the scaffold;
it had run to massacre in the provinces. He feared (and
later his fears proved true at Nantes) that September might
be repeated with the added horror of legal forms. The
Terror finally had reopened the question that of all others
might most easily destroy the State. A handful of men
had pretended to uproot Catholicism for ever, and what
Danton cursed as the “Masque Anti-Religieuse” had
defiled Notre Dame. This flood he was determined to turn
back into the channels of reason; he was going, without
government or police or system, merely by his voice and
his ability, to realise the Revolution, to end the dictatorship,
and to begin the era of prosperity and of content.</p>

<p>The first steps taken were successful. On the very
night of his return, Robespierre was perorating at the
Jacobins against atheism and on the great idea of God,
but within twelve hours, on the morrow, Danton’s voice
gave the new note. It was in the discussion upon the
pension to be paid to the priests whom the last decree had
thrust out of their regular office and of its salary. Danton
spoke with the greatest decision on this plain matter,
and the Convention heard with delight the fresh phrases to
which it had so long been a stranger. He says virtually,
“If you do not pay this sum you are persecutors.” There<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_243"></a>[243]</span>
are in this speech such sentences as these: “You must
appreciate this, that politics can only achieve when they
are accompanied by some reason.... I insist upon your
sparing the blood of men; and I beg the Convention to
be, above all, just to all men except those who are the
declared and open enemies of the Republic.” Four days
later he went a little further, and the Convention still
followed him. On the question which he had most at
heart he spoke plainly. Richard complained of Tours.
He said that the municipality of that town were arresting
“suspects” right and left, and had even attacked himself.
Danton said in a speech of ten lines: “It is high time
the Convention should learn the art of government. Send
these complaints to the Committee. It is chosen, or at
least supposed to be chosen, from the élite of the Convention.”
Later in the same day he spoke on a ridiculous
procession such as the violence of the time had made
fashionable. It was a deputation of Hébertists bringing
from a Parisian church the ornaments of the altar. Already,
it will be remembered, the Commune had ordered
the churches in Paris to be closed, and the attempt to
enforce such scenes were being copied in all the large
towns of France. He said: “Let there be no more of
these mascarades in the Convention.... If people here
and there wish to prove their abjuration of Catholicism,
we are not here to prevent them ... neither are we
here to defend them.... The Terror is still necessary,
the Revolutionary Government is still necessary, but the
people does not demand this indiscriminate action. We
have no business save with the conspirators and with
those who are treating with the enemy.” There was a
protest from Fayan, who cried, “You have talked of
clemency!” for all the world as though such talk was
blasphemy. But Danton was getting back his old position
and was leading the Convention. His success seemed
certain. On the 3rd of December (14th Frimaire) he was<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_244"></a>[244]</span>
violently attacked at the Jacobins, but he managed to
hold his own. Robespierre defended him in a speech
which has been interpreted as a piece of able treachery,
but which may with equal justice be regarded as an
attempt to hold himself between the opposing parties;
and within a fortnight after his return Danton, who had
in him a directness of purpose and a rapidity of action
that prefigured Napoleon, had gained every strategic point
in his attack.</p>

<p>Events helped him, or rather he had foreseen them.
The Vendeans, moving more like a mob than an army,
were caught at Le Mans on the 13th of December. On
the 7th of December the genius of Bonaparte had driven
the English and Spanish from Toulon. On the 26th the
news came to the army of which Hoche had just been
given the command, and, as though the name Bonaparte
brought a fate with it, the lines of Wissembourg were carried,
Landau was relieved, the Austrians passed the Rhine.</p>

<p>All these victories were the allies of the party of indulgence.
The men who said, “The Terror has no <i>raison
d’être</i> save that of the national defence,” found themselves
expressing what all France felt. After such successes it
only remained to add, “The nation is safe; the Terror
may end.” Already Danton had called up a reserve, so
to speak, in the shape of the genius of Desmoulins. The
first issue of “Vieux Cordelier” had appeared, and the
journal was read by all Paris.</p>

<p>That club, in which we saw the origin of Danton’s
fame, was now the Hébertists, and nothing more. The
pamphlets which Camille issued under the leadership of
Danton were given a name that might recall its position
and its politics of the old days. And indeed the two
men most concerned in the new policy of clemency had
been, from their house in the Cour du Commerce, the
heart of the “République des Cordeliers.” There are not
in the history of the Revolution, in all the passages of its<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_245"></a>[245]</span>
eloquence and genius, any words that strike us to-day as
do the words of these six pamphlets which spread over
the winter of the year II. It is a proof of Danton’s clear
vision, of his strong influence, that a distant posterity, far
removed from the passions of 1793, should find its own
expression in the appeals which his friend wrote, and
which form the Testament of the Indulgents.</p>

<p>The first two numbers were an attack upon the
Hébertists alone. Robespierre, from his position in the
Committee of Public Safety, from the spur of his own
ambition, was willing to agree. He himself corrected the
proofs. But on the 15th of December appeared the
famous Numero III., which ran through Paris like a
herald’s message, which did for reaction something of
what the great speeches had done for liberty in clubs
during the early days of the Revolution. Few men cared
to vote, but every man read the “Vieux Cordelier.” To
those who had never so much as heard of Tacitus the
pen of Tacitus carried conviction. A crowd of women
passed before the Parliament crying for the brothers and
husbands who filled the prisons; the “Committee of
Clemency” was within an ace of being formed; and,
coinciding with the victories and with Danton’s reappearance,
the demand of Desmoulins was dragging after it, not
France only (for France was already convinced), but even
the capital. It was then that the Committee, who alone
were the government, grew afraid. Robespierre still
hesitated. He could only succeed through the committees;
but Desmoulins was his friend; there was an appeal
to “the old college friend” in the “Vieux Cordelier”
that touched his heart and his vanity; they had sat
together on the benches of the Louis le Grand, and
Robespierre seems to have made an honest attempt to aid
him then. A fourth number had appeared on the 20th, a
fifth (written on Christmas Day) appeared on January 8th.</p>

<p>The Jacobins denounced Camille, and Robespierre, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_246"></a>[246]</span>
eyes of whose mind looked as closely and were as short-sighted
as the eyes of his body, grew afraid. The men
determined on rigour had warned him in the Committee;
now when he tried to defend Camille he saw the Jacobins
raging: what he did not see was France. Perhaps, had
his sight been longer, he would not have been dragged six
months later to the guillotine. He attempted a compromise
and said: “We will not expel Camille, but we will
burn his journal, punishing his act but not himself.”
Camille answered with Rousseau, “<i>Brûler n’est pas repondre</i>.”
He would not be defended.</p>

<p>The battle was closely joined. Desmoulins was pushing
forward his attack with the audacious infantry of
pamphlets; Danton, from the Convention, was giving from
time to time the heavy blows of the artillery; the advance
was continuous; when there was felt a check that proved
the prelude to disaster and that showed, behind the opposing
lines, the force of the Committees. In the middle of
January, just after Desmoulins’s defence at the Jacobins,
Fabre D’Eglantine, the friend and old secretary of Danton,
was arrested. It was in vain that Danton put into his
defence all the new energy which he had discovered in
himself. It was in vain even that he called for “the
right of the deputy to defend himself at the bar of the
house.” Like all organised governments, the Committee
could give reasons of State for this silent action. Danton
was overborne, and the Convention for the first time since
his return deserted him.</p>

<p>He had yet seven weeks to live. Desmoulins still
attacked, but Danton knew that the action was lost. He
knew the strength of that powerful council whose first
efforts he himself had moulded, and when he saw it arise
in support of continuing the Terror, when he saw it and
Robespierre allied, he lost hope. The policy of the
Committee grew more and more definite. One member
of it, (Hérault de Séchelles) was Danton’s friend: they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_247"></a>[247]</span>
expelled him. Silently, but with all their strength, they
disengaged the government from either side. The Committee
and Robespierre determined to strike at once,
when the occasion should arise, both those in the Commune
who desired to turn the Terror to their own ends
and those of the Convention—the Dantonists, who desired
to end it altogether.</p>

<p>Danton still speaks in the tribune, but the attack is
no longer there. He defends modestly and well the practical
propositions that appear before the Parliament on
education, on the abolition of slavery, on the provisions
for the giving of bail under the new judiciary system, and
so forth. But there is in his attitude something of expectancy.
He is waiting for a sudden attack that must come
and that he cannot prevent. He holds himself ready, but
the Committee is working in the dark, and he does not
know on which side to guard himself. A last personal
interview with Robespierre failed, and there was nothing
left to do but to wait and see whether they feared him
so much as to dare his arrest. It was with Ventose, that
is, with the first days of March, that the blow fell.</p>

<p>The Hébertists, chafing under three months of growing
insults—insults which their old ally the Committee
refused to avenge—broke out into open revolt. Carrier was
back from his truly Hébertist slaughtering at Nantes, and
it was felt at the Cordeliers that the public execration
would destroy them unless they rose. In the autumn
they would have had the Committees on their side, but
the strong action of the Indulgents had broken the
alliance. They determined on insurrection. The Commune
this time was, once and for all, to conquer the
government. The decision was taken at the Cordeliers
on the 4th of March—within ten days they were arrested.
The Committee pushed them through the form of a trial.
Less than three weeks after the first talk of revolt, Hébert,
Clootz, and the rest were guillotined.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_248"></a>[248]</span></p>

<p>There were many among the Dantonists who thought
this the triumph of their policy. “The violent, the enragés
are dead. It is we who did it.” But Danton was
wiser than his followers. He knew that the Committee
were waiting for such an opportunity, and that a blow
to the right would follow that blow to the left. Both
oppositions were doomed. Only one chance remained to
him—they might not dare.</p>

<p>On the occasion of the arrest of the Hébertists he
made a noble speech on the great lines of conciliation and
unity, which had been his constant policy—a speech which
was all for Paris, in spite of the faction.</p>

<p>But that week they determined on his arrest and that
of his friends. Panis heard of it, and sent at once to warn
him. He found him in the night of the last day of March
1794 sitting in his study with his young nephew, moody
and silent. His wife was asleep in the next room. On
the flat above him Camille and Lucille were watching
late. The house was silent. Panis entered and told him
what the Committee had resolved. “Well, what then?”
said Danton. “You must resist.” “That means the
shedding of blood, and I am sick of it. I would rather
be guillotined than guillotine.” “Then,” said Panis, “you
must fly, and at once.” But Danton shook his head still
moodily. “One does not take one’s country with one on
the soles of one’s boots.” But he muttered again to himself,
“They will not dare—they will not dare.” Panis left
him, and he sat down again to wait, for he knew in his
heart that the terrible machine which he himself had
made, and which he had fought so heroically, could dare
what it chose. They left him silent in the dark room.
From time to time he stirred the logs of the fire; the
sudden flame threw a light on the ugly strength of his
face: he bent over the warmth motionless, and with the
memories of seven years in his heart.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VII">CHAPTER VII<br />
<span class="smaller">THE DEATH OF DANTON</span></h2>

</div>

<p>In the night the armed police came round to the Passage
du Commerce; one part of the patrol grounded their
muskets and halted at the exits of the street, the other
entered the house.</p>

<p>Desmoulins heard the butts falling together on the
flagstones, and the little clink of metal which announces
soldiery; he turned to his wife and said, “They have
come to arrest me.” And she held to him till she
fainted and was carried away. Danton, in his study
alone, met the arrest without words. There is hardly
a step in the tragedy that follows which is not marked
by his comment, always just, sometimes violent; but
the actual falling of the blow led to no word. Words
were weapons with him, and he was not one to strike
before he had put up his guard.</p>

<p>They were taken to the Luxembourg, very close by,
a little up the hill. We have the story of how Danton
came with his ample, firm presence into the hall of the
prison, and met, almost the first of his fellow-prisoners,
Thomas Paine. The author of “The Rights of Man”
stepped up to him, doubtless to address him in bad
French.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">[140]</a> Danton forestalled him in the English of which
he was a fair master.</p>

<p>“Mr. Paine,” he said, “you have had the happiness
of pleading in your country a cause which I shall no<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_250"></a>[250]</span>
longer plead in mine.” He remembered Paine’s sane
and moderate view on the occasion of the king’s trial,
and he envied one whose private freedom had remained
untrammelled with the bonds of office; who had never
been forced to a 2nd of June, nor had to keep to an
intimate conversation his fears for the Girondins. Then
he added that if they sent him to the scaffold he would
go gaily. And he did. There was the Frenchman contrasted
with his English friend.</p>

<p>Beaulieu, who heard him, tells us that he also turned
to the prisoners about him and said, “Gentlemen, I had
hoped to have you out of this, and here I am myself; I
can see no issue.”</p>

<p>So the prisoners came in, anxiously watched by reactionaries,
to whom, as to many of our modern scribblers,
one leader of the Revolution is as good as another—Lacroix,
Westermann (the strong soldier with his huge
frame overtopping even Danton’s), and Desmoulins. As
they passed to their separate cells, for it was determined
to prevent their communication, a little spirit of the old
evil<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> used the powerful venom of aristocracy, the unanswerable
repartee of rank, and looking Lacroix up and
down, said, “I could make a fine coachman of that
fellow.” He and his like would have ruined France for
the sake of turning those words into action.</p>

<p>Till the dawn of the 11th Germinal broke, they were
kept in their separate rooms. But the place was not
built for a prison. Lacroix and Danton in neighbouring
rooms could talk by raising their voices, and we have of
their conversation this fragment. Lacroix said, “Had I
ever dreamt of this I could have forestalled it.” And
Danton’s reply, with just that point of fatalism which
had forbidden him to be ambitious, answered, “I knew
it;” he had known it all that night.</p>

<p>There was a force stronger than love—private and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_251"></a>[251]</span>
public fear. It is a folly to ridicule, or even to misunderstand
that fear. The possessions, the families of many,
the newly-acquired dignity of all, above everything, the
new nation had been jeopardised how many times by a
popular idol turned untrue. The songs of 1790 were all
for Louis, many praised Bailly; what a place once had
Lafayette! Who had a word to say against Dumouriez
eighteen months before? The victories had just begun—barely
enough to make men hesitate about the Terror.
The “Vieux Cordelier” had led, not followed opinion, as it
was just that the great centre of energy should lead and
not follow the time. And, men would say, how do we
know why he has been arrested, or at whose voice?
How can we tell where the sure compass of right, our
Robespierre, stands in the matter? and so forth. Nothing
then was done; but Paris very nearly moved.</p>

<p>There were thus two gathering forces; one vague and
large, one small but ordered, and on the result of their
shock hung the life of Danton—may one say (knowing
the future) the life of the Republic?</p>

<p>Now the struggle with Europe had taught the Committee
a principal lesson. Perhaps one should add that
the exuberant fighting power of the nation and of the
age had forced the Committee to a certain method,
apparent in the armies, in the measures, in the speeches:
it was the method of detecting at once the weakest spot
in the opposing line, and of abandoning everything for
the purpose of concentrating all its strength and charging
home. So their descendants to-day in their new army
practise the marvellous massing of artillery which you
may watch at autumn in the manœuvres.</p>

<p>What was the opposing line? A vague ill-ordered
crowd—Paris; the undisciplined Convention, lacking
leaders, ignorant of party rule. Where was its weakness?
In the want of initiative, in the fact that, till
some one spoke, no one could be sure of the strength of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_252"></a>[252]</span>
the corporate feeling. Also, on account of the public
doubt, during that time men were grains of dust; but the
dust was like powder, and speech was always the spark
which permitted the affinities of that powder to meet in
fierce unity and power. A sudden blow had to be struck
and the fire stamped out before it had gathered power;
this is how the check was given.</p>

<p class="tb">In the morning of the 12th Germinal the Convention
met, and each man looked at his neighbour, and then, as
though afraid, let his eyes wander to see if others thought
as he did. At last one man dared to speak. It was
Legendre the butcher;<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">[142]</a> he vacillated later before a mixture
of deceit in others and of doubt in himself, but it
should be remembered to his honour that he nearly saved
the Revolution by an honest word. “Let Danton be heard
at the bar of the Convention,” was his frank demand;
common-sense enough, but it fatally opened his guard,
and gave an opportunity to the thrusts most dangerous
in the year II.—an accusation of desiring privilege, and
an accusation of weakening that government which was
visibly saving the state on the frontiers.</p>

<p>Tallien was President that day, and he gave the reply
to Robespierre. Now Robespierre was no good fencer.
The supreme feint, the final disarming of opinion, was left
to an abler man. He had gone home from the Committee
to Duplay’s house in the early morning; a monomaniac
hardly needing sleep, he reappeared at the early meeting
of the Convention. But, poor debater as he was, he could<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_253"></a>[253]</span>
take advantage of so easy an opportunity. In a speech
which was twice applauded, he asserted that Legendre had
demanded a privilege. He struck the note which above
all others dominated those minds. “Are we here to defend
principles or men? Give the right of speech to
Danton, and you give rein to an extraordinary talent, you
confuse the issue with a hundred memories, you permit
the bias of friendship. Let the man defend himself by
proofs and witnesses, not by eloquence and sentiment.”
Yet he did not add—perhaps he hardly knew—that
the memories and friendship would but have balanced
a direct enmity, and that witnesses and proofs would be
denied. Again he used that argument of government—had
not they saved France? were they not the head of
the police? did not they know in the past what they were
doing? He assured them that a little waiting would produce
conviction in them also. It did not, but time was
gained; already half the Convention doubted.</p>

<p>Legendre, bewildered, faltered a reply; he admitted
error, and begged Robespierre not to misunderstand. He
could have answered for Danton as for himself, but the
tribunal was of course to be trusted. It was almost an
apology.</p>

<p>On that changing, doubtful opinion came with the
force of a steel mould the hard, high voice of St. Just.</p>

<p>St. Just spoke rarely. There has been mention in an
earlier part of this book of the speech against the Girondins.
There will be mention again of a vigorous and a
nearly successful attempt to save Robespierre. That he
should have been given the task of defending the Committee’s
action that day is a singular proof of the grip
which they had of the circumstances. Barrère could never
have convinced an unsympathetic public opinion. Robespierre
could meet a rising enthusiasm with nothing but dry
and accurate phrases. But St. Just had the flame of his
youth and of his energy, and his soul lived in his mouth.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_254"></a>[254]</span></p>

<p>The report, even as we read it, has eloquence.
Coming from him then, with his extreme beauty, his
upright and determined bearing, it turned the scale.
The note of the argument was as ably chosen as could
be; moreover it represented without question the attitude
of his own mind: it was this. “The last of the factions
has to be destroyed; only one obstacle stands between
you and the appreciation of the Republic.<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">[143]</a> Time and
again we have acted suddenly, but time and again we
have acted well and on sufficient reasons—so it is now.
If you save Danton you save a personality—something
you have known and admired; you pay respect to individual
talent, but you ruin the attempt in which you
have so nearly succeeded. For the sake of a man you
will sacrifice all the new liberty which you are giving to
the whole world.” There follows a passionate apostrophe
in which he speaks to Danton as though he stood before
him, as striking as the parallel passage in the fourth
Catiline Oration.<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Had Danton been present he would
have been a man against a boy: a loud and strong voice,
not violent in utterance, but powerful in phrase and in
delivery, a character impressing itself by sheer force of
self upon vacillating opinion. Had Danton spoken in
reply, his hearers would have said with that moral conviction
which is stronger than proof, “This man is the
chief lover of France.”</p>

<p>But such is rhetoric, its falsity and its success—the
gaps of silence grew to a convincing power. The
accusations met with no reply; they remained the echo of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_255"></a>[255]</span>
a living voice; the answers to them could be framed only
in the silent minds of the audience. The living voice
won.</p>

<p>And there was, as we have said, intense conviction
to aid St. Just. He was a man who would forget and
would exaggerate with all the faults of passion, but he
believed the facts he gave. Not so Robespierre. Robespierre
had furnished the notes of St. Just’s report,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> and
Robespierre must have known that he had twisted all to
one end. Robespierre was a man who was virtuous and
true only to his ideal, not to his fellow-men. Robespierre
had not deceived himself as he wrote, but he had deceived
St. Just, and therefore the young “Archangel of Death”
spoke with the added strength of faith, than which nothing
leaps more readily from the lips to the ears. Can we
doubt it? There is a phrase which convinces. When
he ends by telling them what it is they save by sacrificing
one idol, when he describes the Republic, he uses the
phrase common to all apostolates, the superb “les
mots que nous avons dits ne seront jamais perdus sur la
terre”—the things which they had said would never be
lost on earth.</p>

<p>It ended. No one voted; the demand of the Committee
passed without a murmur. The Convention was
never again its own mistress; it had silenced and condemned
itself.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">[146]</a></p>

<p>Meanwhile at the Luxembourg the magistrate Dénizot
was making the preparations for the trial. Each prisoner
was asked the formal question of his guilt, and each<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_256"></a>[256]</span>
replied in a single negative, but Danton added that he
would die a Republican, and to the question of their
defence replied that he would plead his own cause.
Then, at half-past eleven they were transferred to the
Conciergerie.</p>

<p>From that moment his position becomes the attitude
of the man fighting, as we have known it in the crisis of
August 1792 and of the calling up of the armies. Ready
as he had always been to see the real rather than the
imaginary conditions, he recognised death with one chance
only of escape. He knew far better than did poor Desmoulins
the power of a State’s machinery; he felt its
grasp and doubted of any issue. The people, for Desmoulins,
were the delegators of power; for Danton the
people were those who should, but who did not rule.
To live again and enter the arena and save the life
of the Republic the people must hear his voice, or else
the fact of government would be more strong than all
the rights and written justice in the world.</p>

<p>He was like a man whose enemy stands before him,
and who sees at his own side, passive and bewildered, a
strong but foolish ally. His ally was the people, his
enemy was Death.</p>

<p>Therefore we have of his words and actions for the
next four days two kinds: those addressed to death
and those to his ally. Where he desires to touch
the spirit of the crowd—in what was for their ears—we
have the just, practical, and eloquent man apologising
for over-vehemence, saying what should strike hardest
home—an orator, but an orator who certainly uses
legitimate weapons.</p>

<p>But there is another side. In much that he said in
prison, in all that he said on his way to the scaffold, he
is simply speaking to Death and defying him. The
inmost thing in a man, the stock of the race, appears
without restraint; he becomes the Gaul. That most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_257"></a>[257]</span>
un-northern habit of defiance, especially of defiance to
the inevitable and to the strongest, the custom of his
race and their salvation, grows on his lips.</p>

<p>He insults Death, he jests; his language, never chaste
or self-conscious, takes on the laughter of the Rabelaisian,
and (true Rabelaisian again) he wraps up in half-a-dozen
words the whole of a situation.</p>

<p>Thus we see him leaning against the window of his
prison and calling to Westermann in the next cell, “Oh!
if I could leave my legs to Couthon<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">[147]</a> and my virility to
Robespierre, things might still go on.” And again when
Lacroix said, “I will cut my own hair at the neck, so
that Sanson the executioner shall not meddle with it,”
Danton replied, “Yet will Sanson intermeddle with the
vertebræ of your neck.” So he meets death with a broad
torrent of words; and that a civilisation accustomed
rather to reticence should know what this meant in him,
my readers must note his powerful asides to Desmoulins
and to Hérault, coinciding with the fearful pun in which
he tried to raise the drooping courage of D’Eglantine.</p>

<p>Also in his prison this direct growth of the soil of
France “talked often of the fields and of rivers.” Shakespeare
should have given us the death scenes of so
much energy, defiance, coarseness, affection, and great
courage.</p>

<p>In the Conciergerie they spent the rest of the day
waiting for the trial, and this time Danton was next to
Westermann, to whom and to Desmoulins he said, “We
must say nothing save before the Committees or at the
trial.” It was his plan to move the people by a public
defence, but his enemies in power had formed a counter-plan,
and, as we shall see, forestalled him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_258"></a>[258]</span></p>

<p>Desmoulins, “the flower that grew on Danton,” was
still bewildered. So he remained to the end; at the foot
of the scaffold he could not understand. “If I could only
have written a No. VII. I would have turned the tables.”<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">[148]</a>
“It is a duel of Commodus; they have the lance and I
have not even a reed.” To that man, his equal in years,<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">[149]</a>
but a boy compared with him in spirit, Danton had
always shown, and now continued to show, a peculiar
affection. He treated him like a younger brother, and
never made him suffer those violent truths with which
all France and most of his friends were familiar in his
mouth. So now, and in the trial, and on the way to the
scaffold, his one attempt was to calm the bitter violence
and outburst of Camille.</p>

<p>There are two phrases of Danton’s which have been
noted on this first day passed at the Conciergerie, and
which cannot be omitted, though in form they have not
his diction, yet in spirit they might be his; they are
recollections presumably of something of greater length
called to Westermann.</p>

<p>The first: “On such a day<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">[150]</a> I demanded the institution
of the Revolutionary tribunal. I ask pardon of God
and of man.”</p>

<p>The second: “I am leaving everything at sixes and
sevens; one had better be a poor fisherman than meddle
with the art of governing men.” There you have the
real Danton—a reminiscence of some strong and passionate<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_259"></a>[259]</span>
utterance put into this undantonesque and proverbial
form. A real sentiment of his—all of him; careless
of life, intense upon the interests of life, above all upon
the future of the Revolution and of France, knowing the
helpless inferiority of the men he left behind. And in
the close of the phrase it is also he; it is the spirit of
great weariness which had twice touched him, as sleep
an athlete after a day of games. It was soon to take
the form of a noble sentence: “Nous avons assez servi—allons
dormir.”</p>

<p>On the 13th (April 2, 1794), about ten in the morning,
they were led before the tribunal.</p>

<p>The trial began.</p>

<p>It must not be imagined that the Dantonists alone
came before the tribunal to answer for their particular
policy. There had originated under Robespierre (and later
when he alone was the master it was to be terribly abused)
the practice of confusing the issues. Three groups at least
were tried together, and the Moderates sat between two
thieves—for D’Eglantine on a charge of embezzlement
alone, Guzman, the Freys as common thieves and spies to
the Republic, were associated on the same bench. Fourteen
in all, they sat in the following order:—Chabot,
Bazire, Fabre, Lacroix, Danton, Delaunay, Hérault, Desmoulins,
Guzman, Diederichsen, Phillippeaux, D’Espagnac,
and the two Freys. D’Eglantine occupied “the armchair,”
and it will be seen that the <i>five</i>—the Moderates—were
carefully scattered.</p>

<p>The policy was a deliberate one; it was undertaken
with the object of prejudicing public opinion against the
accused. Nor was it permitted to each group to be
separate in accusation and in its method of defence. They
were carefully linked to each other by men accused of
two out of the three crimes.</p>

<p>Herman was president of the tribunal, and sat facing
the prisoners; on either side of him were Masson-Denizot,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_260"></a>[260]</span>
Foucault and Bravé, the assistant-judges. They say that
Voullaud and Vadier, of the lower committee, appeared
behind the bench to watch the enemies whom they had
caught in the net. Seven jurors were in the box to the
judges’ left, by name Renaudin (whom Desmoulins challenged
in vain), Desboisseaux, Trinchard, Dix-Aout, Lumière,
Ganney, Souberbielle,<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">[151]</a> and to these we must add
Topino-Lebrun, whose notes form by far the most vivid
fragment by which we may reconstruct the scene. The
jury of course was packed.<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">[152]</a> It was part of the theory of
the Revolutionary Government that no chance element
should mar its absolute dictatorship. It was practically
a court of judges, absolute, and without division of
powers.</p>

<p>At a table between the President and the prisoners sat
Fouquier-Tinville, the public prosecutor; and finally, on
the judges’ right was the open part of the court and the
door to the witnesses’ room.</p>

<p>Here was a new trial with a great and definite chance
of acquittal, a scene the like of which had not been seen
for a year, nor would be seen again in that room. The
men on the prisoners’ bench had been the masters, one of
them the creator, of the court which tried them; they
were evidently greater and more powerful than their
judges, and had behind them an immense though informal
weight of popularity. They were public men of the
first rank; their judges and the public prosecutor were
known to be merely the creatures of a small committee.
More than this, it was common talk that the Convention
might yet change its mind, and even among the jury it
was certain that discussion would arise.</p>

<p>By the evidence of a curious relic we know that the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_261"></a>[261]</span>
Committee actually feared a decree or a coup-de-main
which would have destroyed their power. This note
remains in the archives, a memorandum of a decision
arrived at in the Committee on the early morning of the
13th or late in the night of the 12th.</p>

<p>“<i>Henriot to be written to, to tell him to issue an order that
the President and the Public Prosecutor of the Revolutionary
Tribunal are not to be arrested.</i>”</p>

<p>Then in another hand:</p>

<p>“<i>Get four members to sign this.</i>”</p>

<p>Finally, the memorandum is endorsed in yet another
hand:</p>

<p>“<i>13th Germinal.—A policeman took this the same
day.</i>”<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">[153]</a></p>

<p>It will thus be seen that the Committee was by no
means sure of its ground. It had indeed procured through
St. Just the decree preventing Danton from pleading at
the bar of the Convention and permitting his trial, but it
would require the most careful manœuvring upon their
part to carry through such an affair. As we shall see,
they just—and only just—succeeded.</p>

<p>The whole of the first day (the 13th Germinal, 2nd
of April 1794) was passed in the formal questions and in
the reading of accusations. Camille, on being asked his
age and dwelling, made the blasphemous and striking
answer which satisfied the dramatic sense, but was not a
true reply to the main question.</p>

<p>Danton gave the reply so often quoted: “I am Danton,
not unknown among the revolutionaries. I shall be
living nowhere soon, but you will find my name in Walhalla.”
The other answers, save that of Hérault, attempted
no phrases.</p>

<p>Yet Guzman would have made more point of his
assertion if he had chosen that moment to say, “I am
Guzman, a grandee of Spain, who came to France to taste<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_262"></a>[262]</span>
liberty, but was arrested for theft;” while the two Freys
missed an historic occasion in not replying, “We are
Julius and Emanuel Frey, sometime nobles of the Empire
under the title of Von Schönfeld, now plain Jews employed
by the Emperor as spies.”</p>

<p>The public prosecutor read the indictment. First at
great length Amar’s report on the India Company. The
details of the accusations which cost Fabre his life need
not be entered into here. Suffice it to say that it was an
indictment for corruption, for having suppressed or altered
for money the decree of the Convention in the autumn
before, and being accomplice in the extra gains which this
had made possible—one of those wretched businesses with
which Panama and South Africa have deluged modern
France and England. It is an example of the methods of
the tribunal that Fouquier managed to drag in Desmoulins’s
name because he had once said, “People complain
of not being able to make money now, yet I make it
easily enough.”</p>

<p>The second group, the Freys, Guzman, the unfrocked
priest D’Espagnac, and Diederichsen the Dane, were
accused of being foreigners working against the success
of the French armies, and at the same time lining their
pockets. In the case of three of them the accusation was
probably true. It was the more readily believed from the
foreign origins of the accused, for France was full of spies,
while the name of a certain contumacious Baron de Bartz
made this list sound the more probable.</p>

<p>Finally, the small group at which they were really aiming
(whose members they had already mixed up with the
thieves) was indicted on nothing more particular than the
report of St. Just—virtually, that is, on Robespierre’s notes.
Danton had served the King, had drawn the people into the
place where they were massacred in July 1791, did not
do his duty on the 10th of August, and so forth—a vapid
useless summary of impossible things in which no one<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_263"></a>[263]</span>
but perhaps St. Just and a group of fanatics believed.
With that the day ended, and they were taken back to
prison.</p>

<p>On the next day, the 14th Germinal (3rd of April
1794), Westermann, who, though already arrested, had
only been voted upon in Parliament the day before,
appeared on the prisoners’ bench, and sat at the end after
Emanuel Frey. He was the last and not the least noble
of the Dantonists, with his great stature, his clumsy intellect,
and his loyal Teutonic blood.</p>

<p>“Who are you?” they said. “I am Westermann.
Show me to the people. I was a soldier at sixteen, and
have been a councillor of Strasbourg. I have seven
wounds in front, and I was never stabbed in the back
till now.”</p>

<p>This was the man who had led the 10th of August,
and who had dared, in his bluff nature, to parley with the
Swiss who spoke his language.</p>

<p>It was after some little time passed in the interrogation
of the prisoners who had been arrested for fraud, especially
of D’Espagnac, that the judge turned to Danton.</p>

<p>In the debate and cross-questioning that followed we
must depend mainly upon the notes of Lebrun,<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">[154]</a> for they
are more living, although they are more disconnected, than
the official report. We discover in them the passionate
series of outbursts, but a series which one must believe to
have had a definite purpose. There was neither hope of
convincing the tribunal nor of presenting a legal argument
with effect. What Danton was trying to do in this court,
which was not occupied with a trial, but merely in a
process of condemnation, was to use it as a rostrum from
which he could address the people, the general public,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_264"></a>[264]</span>
upon whose insurrection he depended. He perhaps depended
also on the jury, for, carefully chosen as they were,
they yet might be moved by a man who had never failed
to convince by his extraordinary power of language. He
carries himself exactly as though he were technically what
he is in fact—a prisoner before an informal group of executioners,
who appeals for justice to the crowd.</p>

<p>He pointed at Cambon, who had sat by him on the
Committee, and said, “Come now, Cambon, do you think
we are conspirators? Look, he is laughing; he believes
no such thing.” Then he turned, laughing himself, to
the jury and said, “Write down in your notes that he
laughed.”</p>

<p>Again, he uses phrases like these: “We are here for
a form, but if we are to have full liberty to speak, and if
the French people is what it should be, it will be my
business later to ask their pardon for my accusers.” To
which Camille answered, “Oh, we shall be allowed to
speak, and that is all we want,” and the group of Indulgents
laughed heartily.</p>

<p>It was just after this that he began that great harangue
in answer to the questions of the judge, an effort whose
tone reaches to this day. It is, perhaps, the most striking
example of a personal appeal that can be discovered. The
opportunities for such are rare, for in the vast majority of
historical cases where a man has pleaded for his life, it
has either been before a well-organised court, or before a
small number of determined enemies, or by the lips of
one who was paid for his work and who ignored the art
of political oratory. The unique conditions of the French
Revolution made such a scene possible, perhaps for the
only time in history.</p>

<p>The day, early as was the season, was warm, the
windows of the court, that looked upon the Seine, were
open, and through the wide doors pressed the head of a
great crowd. This crowd stretched out along the corridor,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_265"></a>[265]</span>
along the quays, across the Pont Neuf, and even to the
other side of the river. Every sentence that told was
repeated from mouth to mouth, and the murmurs of the
crowd proved how closely the great tribune was followed.
In the attitude which had commanded the attention of
his opponents when he presented the first deputation
from Paris three years before, and that had made him
so striking a figure during the stormy months of 1793,
he launched the phrases that were destined for Paris
and not for his judges. His loud voice (the thing appears
incredible, but it is true) vibrating through the
hall and lifted to the tones that had made him the
orator of the open spaces, rang out and was heard beyond
the river.</p>

<p>“You say that I have been paid, but I tell you that
men made as I am cannot be paid. And I put against
your accusation—of which you cannot furnish a proof nor
the hint of a proof, nor the shadow nor the beginning of
a witness—the whole of my revolutionary career. It was
I who from the Jacobins kept Mirabeau at Paris. I have
served long enough, and my life is a burden to me, but I
will defend myself by telling you what I have done. It was
I who made the pikes rise suddenly on the 20th of June
and prevented the King’s voyage to St. Cloud. The day
after the massacre of the Champ de Mars a warrant was
out for my arrest. Men were sent to kill me at Arcis,
but my people came and defended me. I had to fly to
London, and I came back, as you all know, the moment
Garran was elected. Do you not remember me at the
Jacobins, and how I asked for the Republic? It was I
who knew that the court was eager for war. It was I,
among others, who denounced the policy of the war.”</p>

<p>Here a sentence was heard: “What did you do against
the Brissotins?”</p>

<p>Now Danton had, as we know, done all in his power
to save the men who hated him, but whom he admired.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_266"></a>[266]</span>
It was no time for him to defend himself by an explanation
of this in the ears of the people who had never understood,
as he had, the height of the men who followed
Vergnaud; but he said what was quite true: “I told
them that they were going to the scaffold. When I
was a minister I said it to Brissot before the whole
cabinet.”</p>

<p>He might have added that he had said to Guadet in
the November woods on the night before he left for the
army, “You are headstrong, and it will be your doom.”<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">[155]</a></p>

<p>Then he went back again to the list of his services.
“It was I who prepared the 10th of August. You say I
went to Arcis. I admit it, and I am proud of it. I went
there to pass three days, to say good-bye to my mother,
and to arrange my affairs, because I was shortly to be in
peril. I hardly slept that night. It was I that had Mandat
killed, because he had given the order to fire on the
people.... You are reproaching me with the friendship
of Fabre D’Eglantine. He is still my friend, and I still
say that he is a good citizen as he sits here with me.
You have told me that my defence has been too violent,
you have recalled to me the revolutionary names, and you
have told me that Marat when he appeared before the
tribunal might have served as my model. Well, with
regard to those names who were once my friends, I will
tell you this: Marat had a character on fire and unstable;
Robespierre I have known as a man, above all, tenacious;
but I—I have served in my own fashion, and I would
embrace my worst enemy for the sake of the country, and
I will give her my body if she needs the sacrifice.”</p>

<p>This short and violent speech, which I have attempted
to reproduce from the short, disjointed, ill-spelt notes of
Lebrun, hit the mark. The crowd, the unstable crowd,
which he contemned as he passed to the guillotine, moved
like water under a strong wind; and his second object also<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_267"></a>[267]</span>
was reached, for the tribunal grew afraid. These phrases
would soon be repeated in the Convention, and no means
had been taken to silence that terrible voice. The President
of the court said to him that it was the part of an
accused man to defend himself with proofs and not with
rhetoric. He parried that also with remarkable skill, saying
in a much quieter tone which all his friends (they
were now growing in number) immediately noted: “That
a man should be violent is wrong in him I know, unless
it is for the public good, and such a violence has often
been mine. If I exceeded now, it was because I found
myself accused with such intolerable injustice.” He raised
his voice somewhat again with the words, “But as for
you, St. Just, you will have to answer to posterity,” and
then was silent.</p>

<p>When the unhappy man who had taken upon his
shoulders the vile duty of the political work that day,
when Herman was himself upon his trial, he said, “Remember
that this affair was out of the ordinary, and was
a political trial,” when a voice rose from the court,
“There are no political trials under a Republic.” He
would have done well, obscure as he is before history, to
have saved his own soul by refusing a task which he
knew to involve injustice from beginning to end.</p>

<p>It was at the close of that day that three short notes
passed between Herman and the public prosecutor,
Fouquier-Tinville. Herman wrote, “In half an hour I
shall stop Danton’s defence. You must spin out some of
the rest in detail.” Tinville answered, “I have something
more to say to Danton about Belgium;” and Herman
replied, “Do not bring it in with regard to any of
the others.” This little proof of villany, which has survived
by so curious an accident (it is in the Archives to-day),<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
closed the proceedings of that hearing.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_268"></a>[268]</span></p>

<p>The next day, the 15th of Germinal (4th April),
Danton himself said little. It was given over mainly to
the examination of Desmoulins; and as with Danton it
had been rumours or opinions, so with Desmoulins only
the vague sense of things he had written were brought in
to serve as evidence in this tragic farce.</p>

<p>Fouquier, the distant cousin of Camille, to whom he
owed the post in which he was earning his bread by
crime,<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> tried to put something of complaint against the
nation and of hatred to the Republic into his reading
of the Old Cordelier. Even in his thin unpleasant voice
there was only heard the noble phrase of Tacitus, and—it
is a singular example of what the tribunal had become—they
dared not continue the quotation because every
word roused the people in the court. But Camille, so
great with the pen, had nothing of the majesty or the
strength of Danton. His defence was a weak, disconnected
excuse, and, like all men who are insufficient to themselves,
he was inconsistent.</p>

<p>Hérault made on that same day a far finer reply.
Noble by birth, holding by his traditions and memories to
that society which he himself had helped to destroy, and
of which Talleyrand has said, “Those who have not known
it have not lived;” accustomed from his very first youth
to prominence in his profession and to the favour of the
court, he remained to the last full of contempt for so
much squalor, and he veiled his eyes with pride.</p>

<p>“I understand nothing of this topsy-turvydom. I
was a diplomat, and I made the neutrality of Switzerland,
so saving 60,000 men to the Republic. As for the priest
you talk about, who was guillotined in my absence at
Troyes, I knew him well. He was a Canon, if I remember,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_269"></a>[269]</span>
and by no means a reactionary. You are probably joking
about it. It is true he had not taken the oath, but he
was a good man; he helped me, and I am not ashamed
of my friendship. I will tell you something more. On
the 14th of July two men were killed, one on either side
of me.” He might have added, “I was the second man
to scale the Towers.”</p>

<p>It was not until the day’s proceedings had been drawn
out for a considerable time that a sentence was spoken,
the full import of which was not understood at the time,
but which was, as a fact, the first step in those four
months of irresponsibility and crime which are associated
with the name of Robespierre, and which hang like a
weight around the neck of the French nation. Lacroix
had just said with a touch of legal phraseology, “I must
insist that the witnesses whom I have demanded should
be subpœnaed, and if there is any difficulty about this, I
formally demand that the Convention shall be consulted
in the matter;” when the public prosecutor answered,
“It is high time that this part of the trial, which has become
a mere struggle, and which is a public scandal,
should cease. I am about to write to the Convention
to hear what it has to say, and its advice shall be exactly
followed.”</p>

<p>Both the public prosecutor and the judge signed the
letter. The first draft which Fouquier had drawn up was
thought too strong, and it appears that Herman revised
it.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> “Citoyens Représentants,—There has been a storm
in the hall since this day’s proceedings began. The
accused are calling for witnesses who are among your
deputies.... They are appealing to the people, saying
that they will be refused. In spite of the firmness of the
president and of all the tribunal, they continue to protest
that they will not be silent until their witnesses are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_270"></a>[270]</span>
heard, unless by your passing a special decree.” [This was
false, and was the only part of the letter calculated to
impress the Parliament.] “We wish to hear your orders
as to what we shall do in the face of this demand; the
procedure gives us no way by which we can refuse
them.”</p>

<p>But note the way in which the letter was presented to
a Parliament in which there yet remained so much sympathy
for the accused, and the way in which it was
received. St. Just appeared in the tribune with the letter
in his hands, and, instead of reading it, held it up before
them and made this speech:—</p>

<p>“The public prosecutor of the Revolutionary Tribunal
has sent to tell you that the prisoners are in full revolt,
and have interrupted the hearing, saying they will not
allow it to continue until the Convention has taken
measures. You have barely escaped from the greatest
danger which has yet menaced our new liberty, and this
revolt in the very seat of justice, of men panic-stricken
by the law, shows what is in their minds. Their despair
and their fury are a plain proof of the hypocrisy which
they showed in keeping a good face before you. Innocent
men do not revolt. Dillon, who ordered his army to
march on Paris, has told us that Desmoulins’s wife received
money to help the plot. Our thanks are due to you for
having put us in the difficult and dangerous post that we
occupy. Your Committees will answer you by the most
careful watching,” and so forth. When the Convention
had had laid before them every argument and every
flattery which could falsify their point of view, he proposed
the decree that any prisoner who should attempt to
interrupt the course of justice by threats or revolt should
be outlawed.</p>

<p>As they were about to vote, Billaud Varennes added
his word, “I beg the Convention to listen to a letter
which the Committees have received from the police concerning<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_271"></a>[271]</span>
the conspirators, and their connection with the
prisoners.” The letter is not genuine. Even if it were,
it depends entirely upon the word of one obscure and untrustworthy
man (Laflotte), but it did the work. The
Committees, as we know, were names to conjure with.
Their secret debates, their evident success, the fact that
their members had been chosen for the very purpose of
guarding the interests of the Republic, all fatally told
against the prisoners. The decree passed without a vote.
Robespierre asked that the letter might be read in full
court, and his demand was granted. It was from that
letter, from this obscure and uncertain origin, that there
dated the legend of the “conspiracy in the prisons”
which was to cost the lives of so many hundreds.</p>

<p>It was at the very close of this day, the 4th of April,
that the decree of the Convention was brought back to
the tribunal. Amar brought it and gave it to Fouquier,
saying, “Here is what you wanted.” Fouquier smiled and
said, “We were in great need of it.” It was read in the
tribunal. When Camille heard the name of his wife
mentioned in connection with St. Just’s demand he cried
out, “Will they kill her too?” and David, who was sitting
behind the judges, said, “We hold them at last.”<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">[159]</a></p>

<p>The fourth day, the 16th Germinal (5th April), the
court met at half-past eight in the morning, instead of at
the ordinary hour of ten. Almost at once, before the
accused had time to begin their tactics of the day before,
the decree was read. The judge, relying on the law which
had already been in operation against others, and which
gave the jury the right to say after three days whether
they were satisfied, turned to them, and they asked leave
to deliberate.</p>

<p>Before the prisoners had passed into the prison Desmoulins
had found time to tear the defence which he had
written into small pieces, and to throw them at the feet<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_272"></a>[272]</span>
of the judge. Danton cried out, and checked himself in
the middle of his sentence. All save poor Camille had
kept their self-control. He, however, clung to the dock,
determined on making some appeal to the people, or to
the judges, or to posterity. Danton, who calmed him a
few hours later at the foot of the scaffold, could do nothing
with him then, and it was in the midst of a terrible
violence that the fifteen disappeared.</p>

<p>The prisoners were taken back to the Conciergerie,
but in their absence occurred a scene which is among the
most instructive of the close of the Revolution. One of
the jury could not bring himself to declare the guilt of
men whom he knew to be innocent. Another said to
him, “This is not a trial; it is a sacrifice. Danton and
Robespierre cannot exist together; which do you think
most necessary to the Republic?” The unhappy man,
full of the infatuation of the time, stammered out, “Why,
Robespierre is necessary, of course, but——” “It is
enough; in saying that you have passed judgment.”
And it came about in this way that the unanimous
verdict condemned the Indulgents. Lhuillier alone was
acquitted.</p>

<p>Of what passed in the prison we only know from the
lips of an enemy,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> but I can see Danton talking still
courageously of a thousand things; sitting in his chair
of green damask and drinking his bottle of Burgundy
opposite the silver and the traps of D’Eglantine.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> They
were not taken back to hear their sentence; it was read
to them, as a matter of form, in the Conciergerie itself.
Ducray read it to them one by one as they were brought
into his office. Danton refused to hear it in patience;
he hated the technicality and the form, and he knew
that he was condemned long ago. He committed himself
to a last burst of passion before summoning his strength<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_273"></a>[273]</span>
to meet the ordeal of the streets, and followed his anger
by the insults which for days he had levelled at death.
Then for a few hours they kept a silence not undignified,
save only Camille, unfitted for such trials, and moaning
to himself in a corner of the room, whom Danton continually
tried to console, a task in which at the very end
of their sad journey he succeeded. It was part of his
broad mind to understand even a writer and an artist, he
who had never written and had only done.</p>

<p>It was between half-past four and five o’clock in the
evening of the same day, the 5th of April 1794, that the
prisoners reappeared. Two carts were waiting for them
at the great gate in the court of the Palais—the gate
which is the inner entrance to the Conciergerie to-day.<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">[162]</a>
About the carts were a numerous escort mounted and
with drawn swords, but the victims took their seats as
they chose, and of the fifteen the Dantonists remained
together. Hérault, Camille, Lacroix, Westermann, Fabre,
Danton went up the last into the second cart, and the
procession moved out of the courtyard and turned to the
left under the shadow of the Palais, and then to the left
again round the Tour de l’Horloge, and so on to the quay.
They passed the window of the tribunal, the window from
which Danton’s loud voice had been heard across the
river; they went creaking slowly past the old Mairie, past
the rooms that had been Roland’s lodgings, till they
came to the corner of the Pont Neuf; and as the carts
turned from the trees of the Place Dauphine on to the
open bridge, they left the shade and passed into the full
blaze of the westering sun within an hour of its setting.</p>

<p>Early as was the season, the air was warm and
pleasant, the leaves and the buds were out on the few
trees, the sky was unclouded. All that fatal spring was
summerlike, and this day was the calmest and most<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_274"></a>[274]</span>
beautiful that it had known. The light, already tinged
with evening, came flooding the houses of the north bank
till their glass shone in the eyes. There it caught the
Café de l’École where Danton had sat a young lawyer
seven years before, and had seen the beauty of his first
wife in her father’s house; to the right the corner of the
old Hotel de Ville caught the glow, to the left the Louvre
flamed with a hundred windows.</p>

<p>Where the light poured up the river and came reflected
from the Seine on to the bridge, it marked out the
terrible column that was moving ponderously forward to
death. A great crowd, foolish, unstable, varied, of whom
some sang, some ran to catch a near sight of the “Indulgents,”
some pitied, and a few understood and despaired
of the Republic—all these surging and jostling as a
crowd will that is forced to a slow pace and confined by
the narrowness of an old thoroughfare, stretched from
one end of the bridge to the other, and you would have
seen them in the sunlight, brilliant in the colours that
men wore in those days, while here and there a red cap
of liberty marked the line of heads.</p>

<p>But in the centre of this crowd and showing above it,
could be seen the group of men who were about to die.
The carts hidden by the people, the horses’ heads just
showing above the mob, surrounded by the sharp gleams
that only come from swords, there rose distinguished the
figures of the Dantonists. There stood Hérault de
Séchelles upright, his face contemptuous, his colour high,
“as though he had just risen from a feast.” There on
the far side of the cart sat Fabre D’Eglantine, bound, ill,
collapsed, his head resting on his chest, muttering and
complaining. There on the left side, opposite Fabre,
is Camille, bound but still frenzied, calling loudly to the
people, raving, “Peuple, pauvre Peuple!” He still kept
in his poet’s head the dream of the People! They had
been deceived, but they were just, they would save him.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_275"></a>[275]</span>
He wrestled with his ropes and tore his shirt open at the
bosom, clenching his bound hands—clutched in his
fingers through all the struggle shone the bright hair of
Lucille. Danton stood up immense and quiet between
them. One of those broad shoulders touched D’Eglantine,
the other Desmoulins; their souls leant upon his body.
And such comfort as there was or control in the central
group came out like warmth from the chief of these
friends.</p>

<p>He had been their leader and their strength for five
years; they were round him now like younger brothers
orphaned. The weakness of one, the vices of another,
came leaning for support on the great rock of his form.
For these were not the Girondins, the admirable stoics, of
whom each was a sufficient strength to his own soul:
they were the Dantonists, who had been moulded and
framed by the strength and genius of one man. He did
not fail them a moment in the journey, and he died last
to give them courage.</p>

<p>As they passed on and left the river, they lost the
light again and plunged into shadow; the cool air was
about them in the deep narrow streets. They could see
the light far above them only, as they turned into the
gulf of the Rue St. Honoré, down which the lives of men
poured like a stream to be lost and wasted in the Place de
la Revolution. Up its steep sides echoed and re-echoed
the noise of the mob like waves. They could see as they
rolled slowly along the people at the windows, the men
sitting in the cafés or standing up to watch them go by.
One especially Danton saw suddenly and for a moment.
He was standing with a drawing-book in his hand and
sketching rapidly with short interrupted glances. It was
David, an enemy.</p>

<p>Then there appeared upon their left another sight;
it was the only one in that long hour which drove
Danton out of his control: it was the house of Duplay.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_276"></a>[276]</span>
There, hidden somewhere behind the close shutters, was
Robespierre. They all turned to it loudly, and the
sentence was pronounced which some say God has
executed—that it should disappear and not be known
again, and be hidden by high walls and destroyed.</p>

<p>The house was silent, shut, blockaded. It was like a
thing which is besieged and which turns its least sentient
outer part to its enemies. It was beleaguered by the
silent and unseen forces which we feel pressing everywhere
upon the living. For it contained the man who
had sent that cartload of his friends to death. Their
fault had been to preach the permanent sentiments of
mankind, to talk of mercy, and to recall in 1794 the
great emotions of the early Revolution—the desire for
the Republic where every kind of man could sit and
laugh at the same table, the Republic of the Commensales.
They were the true heirs of the spirit of the Federations,
and it was for this that they were condemned. Even at
this last moment there radiated from them the warmth
of heart that proceeds from a group of friends and lovers
till it blesses the whole of a nation with an equal affection.
Theirs had been the instinct of and the faith in the happy
life of the world. It was for this that the Puritan had
struck them down; and yet it is the one spirit that
runs through any enduring reform, the only spirit that
can lead us at last to the Republic.</p>

<p>In a remote room, where the noise of the wheels
could not reach him, sat the man who, by some fatal
natural lack or some sin of ambition unrepented, had
become the Inquisitor—the mad, narrow enemy of mercy
and of all good things.</p>

<p>For a moment he and his error had the power to
condemn, repeating a tragedy of which the world is never
weary—the mean thing was killing the great.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, if you will consider the men in the
tumbril, you will find them not to be pitied except for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_277"></a>[277]</span>
two things, that they were loved by women whom they
could not see, and that they were dying in the best and
latest time of their powerful youth. All these young
men were loved, and in other things they should be
counted fortunate. They had with their own persons
already transformed the world. Here the writer knew
that his talent, the words he had so carefully chosen and
with such delight in his power, had not been wasted
upon praise or fortune, but had achieved the very object.
There the orator knew and could remember how his
great voice had called up the armies and thrown back
the kings.</p>

<p>But if the scene was a tragedy, it was a tragedy of
the real that refused to follow the unities. All nature
was at work, crowded into the Revolutionary time, and
the element that Shakespeare knew came in of itself—the
eternal comedy that seems to us, according to our mood,
the irony, the madness, or the cruelty of things, was
fatally present to make the day complete; and the
grotesque, like a discordant note, contrasted with and
emphasised the terrible.</p>

<p>Fabre, who had best known how omnipresent is this
complexity—Fabre, who had said, “Between the giving
and taking of snuff there is a comedy”—furnished the
example now. Danton hearing so much weakness and
so many groans from the sick man said, “What is your
complaint?” He answered, “I have written a play
called ‘The Maltese Orange,’ and I fear the police have
taken it, and that some one will steal it and get the
fame.” Poor Fabre! It is lost, and no one has the
ridicule of his little folly. Danton answered him with a
phrase to turn the blood: “Tais toi! Dans une semaine
tu feras assez de vers,” and imposed silence. Nor did
this satisfy Fate; there were other points in the framework
of the incongruous which she loves to throw round
terror. A play was running in the opera called the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_278"></a>[278]</span>
“10th of August;” in this the Dantonists were represented
on the stage. When the Dantonists were hardly
buried it was played again that very night, and actors
made up for Hérault and the rest passed before a public
that ignored or had forgotten what the afternoon had
seen. More than this, there was already set in type a
verse which the street-hawkers cried and sold that very
night. For the sake of its coincidence I will take the
liberty of translating it into rhymed heroics:—</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
<div class="poetry">
  <div class="stanza">
    <div class="verse indent0">“When Danton, Desmoulins, and D’Eglantine</div>

  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Danton spared only Camille, and as he did not stop
appealing to the people, told him gently to cease. “Leave
the rabble there,” he said, “leave them alone.” But for
himself he kept on throwing angry jests at death. “May
I sing?” he said to the executioner. Sanson thought
he might, for all he knew. Then Danton said to him,
“I have made some verses, and I will sing them.” He
sang loudly a verse of the fall of Robespierre, and then
laughed as though he had been at the old café with
his friends.</p>

<p>There was a man (Arnault of the Academy) who
lived afterwards to a great age, and who happened to be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_279"></a>[279]</span>
crossing the Rue St. Honoré as the carts went past. In
a Paris that had all its business to do, many such men
came and went, almost forgetting that politics existed
even then. But this batch of prisoners haunted him.
He had seen Danton standing singing with laughter, he
hurried on to the Rue de la Monnaie, had his say with
Michael, who was awaiting him, and then, full of the
scene, ran back across the Tuilleries gardens, and pressing
his face to the railings looked over the great Place de la
Révolution. The convoy had arrived, the carts stood at
the foot of the guillotine, and his memory of the scene is
the basis of its history.</p>

<p>It was close on six, and the sun was nearly set behind
the trees of the Étoile; it reddened the great plaster
statue of Liberty which stood in the middle of the Place,
where the obelisk is now, and to which Madame Roland
delivered her last phrase. It sent a level beam upon the
vast crowd that filled the square, and cast long shadows,
sending behind the guillotine a dark lane over the people.
The day had remained serene and beautiful to the last,
the sky was stainless, and the west shone like a forge.
Against it, one by one, appeared the figures of the condemned.
Hérault de Séchelles, straight and generous in
his bearing, first showed against the light, standing on
the high scaffold conspicuous. He looked at the Garde
Meuble, and from one of its high windows a woman’s hand
found it possible to wave a farewell. Lacroix next,
equally alone; Camille, grown easy and self-controlled,
was the third. One by one they came up the few steps,
stood clearly for a moment in the fierce light, black or
framed in scarlet, and went down.</p>

<p>Danton was the last. He had stood unmoved at the
foot of the steps as his friends died. Trying to embrace
Hérault before he went up, roughly rebuking the executioner
who tore them asunder, waiting his turn without
passion, he heard the repeated fall of the knife in the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_280"></a>[280]</span>
silence of the crowd. His great figure, more majestic
than in the days of his triumph, came against the sunset.
The man who watched it from the Tuilleries gate grew
half afraid, and tells us that he understood for a moment
what kind of things Dante himself had seen. By an
accident he had to wait some seconds longer than the
rest; the executioner heard him muttering, “I shall never
see her again ... no weakness,” but his only movement
was to gaze over the crowd. They say that a face met
his, and that a sacramental hand was raised in absolution.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">[164]</a></p>

<p>He stood thus conspicuous for a moment over the
people whom he had so often swayed. In that attitude
he remains for history. When death suddenly strikes a
friend, the picture which we carry of him in our minds is
that of vigorous life. His last laughter, his last tones of
health, his rapid step, or his animated gesture reproduce
his image for ever. So it is with Danton; there is no
mask of Danton dead, nor can you complete his story
with the sense of repose. We cannot see his face in the
calm either of triumph or of sleep—the brows grown level,
the lips satisfied, the eyelids closed. He will stand
through whatever centuries the story of the Revolution
may be told as he stood on the scaffold looking westward
and transfigured by the red sun, still courageous,
still powerful in his words, and still instinct with that
peculiar energy, self-forming, self-governing, and whole.
He has in his final moment the bearing of the tribune,
the glance that had mastered the danger in Belgium, the
force that had nailed Roland to his post in September,
and that had commanded the first Committee. The
Republic that he desired, and that will come, was proved
in his carriage, and passed from him into the crowd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_281"></a>[281]</span></p>

<p>When Sanson put a hand upon his shoulder the
ghost of Mirabeau stood by his side and inspired him
with the pride that had brightened the death-chamber
of three years before. He said, “Show my head to the
people; it is well worth the while.” Then they did what
they had to do, and without any kind of fear, his great
soul went down the turning in the road.</p>

<p>They showed his head to the people, and the sun set.
There rose at once the confused noise of a thousand
voices that rejoiced, or questioned, or despaired, and
in the gathering darkness the Parisians returned through
the narrow streets eastward to their homes.</p>

<span class="smaller">ROBESPIERRE</span></h2>

</div>

<p>I desire in this additional chapter to show what place
Danton filled in the Revolution by describing the madness
and the reaction that followed his loss; and the
extent to which his influence, in spite of these, was permanent.</p>

<p>When Danton disappeared, one man remained the
master of the terrible machine which he had created. It
remains to show what were the fortunes of his work when
death had come to complete the results of his abdication.</p>

<p>The genius of the dead man had foreseen a necessity,
had met it with an institution, and that institution had
proved his wisdom by its immense success. France was
one within, and was beginning on her frontiers the war
whose success was not to end until it had rebuilt all
Europe. This unprecedented power dominated a country
long used to centralisation, and was strengthened by the
accidents of the time, by the even play of the government
over a surface where all local obstacles had broken down,
by the tacit acquiescence of every patriotic man (for it
was the thing that saved the nation), by the very abuse
of punitive measures. This power was destined to change
from a machine to a toy.</p>

<p>They say the children of that time had little models
of the guillotine to play with. The statement is picturesque
and presumably false, but it will serve well for a
simile. A man unused to action, dreaming of a perfect
state which was but a reflection of his own intensely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_283"></a>[283]</span>
concentrated mind, acquired the control of the guillotine.
Unfortunately the model was of full size.</p>

<p>The punishment of death had hitherto been inflicted,
for the most part, with a clear and definite, though often
with an immoral, object. In the hands of Robespierre it
was used to defend a theory and a whim. The men of
the time loved their country ardently, and believed with
the firmness of a large and generous faith in those principles
upon which all our civilisation is at present based.
France and the Republic were, in their minds, one thing,
and a thing which they spared no means to make survive
the most terrible struggle into which any nation has ever
dared to enter. They killed that they might be obeyed
in a time which verged on anarchy, and they desired to
be obeyed because, but for obedience to government,
France and all her liberties would have perished. Such
a motive for punishment is just, and its execution is
honest.</p>

<p>By the side of this and beyond it were the excesses,
those excesses in protest against which Danton himself
had died. Execrable as were these, infamous as will ever
remain their most conspicuous actors, Hébert and Carrier,
they were prompted by a motive which is of the commonest
and the most easily understood in human affairs.
They were actions of revenge. Danton had said once
and sincerely, “I can find no use for hate.” It was the
key to his successful effort, by far the most creative in a
time when all was energy, that no part of his strength
was lost in personal attack, hardly any in personal defence.
This could no more be said of his contemporaries than it
can be said of the bulk of men in any nation, even in
times of order and of peace. And everywhere, in Nantes,
in Lyons, in the Vendée, in the accusation of Marie
Antoinette, from the very beginning of the Terror, this
hate had surged and broken. The Girondins were put to
death on a charge full of the spirit of revenge; and as the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_284"></a>[284]</span>
autumn grew into winter, in the very crisis of that oppression
by which the nation had been saved, the accusations
became trivial, the process of justice more and more of a
personal act, depending in the provinces on the temper of
an emissary, in Paris upon the summary judgment of the
Committee and the Tribunal.</p>

<p>But all this had so far been comprehensible. With
the advent of Robespierre to full power we have to deal
with a phase of history which will hardly be understood
in happier times. Danton, who saw straight, who understood,
and who, when the victories began, found leisure to
pity, is a type whose extremes are the romance, whose
moderation is the groundwork of history. We have to
deal in him with an enthusiast who is also a statesman, in
whom the mind has sufficient power to know itself even
in its violence, and to return deliberately within its usual
boundaries after never so fantastic an excursion. With
Hébert again we know the type. Those are not rare in
whom passions purely personal dominate all abstract conceptions,
and whose natures desire the horrible in literature
during times of peace, and satisfy their desire by
action during their moments of power.</p>

<p>But with Robespierre an absolutely different feature
is presented: the man who could laugh and the man
who could hate, the right and the left wing have disappeared,
and there is left standing alone a personality
which had gradually become the idol of the city. He
could neither laugh nor hate; the love of country itself,
which illuminates so much in the Revolution, and which
explains so many follies in the smaller men, even that was
practically absent in the mind of Robespierre. His character
would have fitted well with the absence of the
human senses, and should some further document discover
to historians that he lacked the sense of taste, that he was
colour-blind, or that he could not distinguish the notes of
music, these details would do much to complete the imperfect<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_285"></a>[285]</span>
and troubling picture. For in the sphere that is
above, but co-ordinate with, physical life, all those avenues
by which our fellow-beings touch us more nearly than
ideas were closed to him.</p>

<p>It is possible that he may take, centuries hence, the
appearance of majesty. He had the reserve, the dignity,
the intense idealism, the perfect belief in himself, the
certitude that others were in sympathy—all the characteristics,
in fine, which distinguish the Absolutists and the
great Reformers. In his iron code of theory we seem to
hear the ghost of a Calvin, in his reiterated morals and
his perpetual application of them there is the occasional
sharp reminiscence of a Hildebrand. The famous death
cry, “I have loved justice and hated iniquity, therefore I
die in exile,” is not so far distant from “... <i>de mourir
pour le peuple et d’en être abhorré</i>.”</p>

<p>We are accustomed to clothe such figures with a
solemn drapery, and to lend them, at great distances of
time, a certain terrible grandeur. Robespierre is too near
us, he is too well known, and his reforms failed too utterly,
for this to be now the case with him. Yet it may well
happen that some one else treading in the same path,
and succeeding, will see fit to build a legend round his
name.</p>

<p>What then was the ideal which he pursued—this
“one idea,” which stood so perpetually before him as to
exclude the sight of all human things, of sufferings, of
memories, of patriotism itself? It was the civic ideal of
Rousseau, in so far as he conformed to it, and nothing
more.</p>

<p>The ideas of the great reformers must of their nature
be simple—unworkably simple. But Robespierre’s idea
was less than simple—it was thin. Now and again in
the history of upheavals a type has been defined with
special formulæ, which in its original shape could never
have survived the conditions of active existence, but which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_286"></a>[286]</span>
was real enough to receive accretions, and robust enough
to bear moulding until at length it became the living
nucleus of a new society, changed, transformed in a
thousand details, yet in its main lines the ideal of the
founder. With all the great reforms of the world some
such type has been present; the Puritan, the knight of
chivalry, were at first but a faint figure realised in a few
phrases.</p>

<p>Rousseau himself had created such a type, and it has
survived; for what permanent fortunes a century is insufficient
to show. The Republican citizen of Jean-Jacques
stood in the generation which succeeded him the centre
of a new society; in a thousand shapes he really lived.
Thomas Jefferson, William Cobbett, were living men to
whom this ideal stood for model; not in its details, but in
its main lines. Such noble men are to be met to-day on
every side.</p>

<p>But Robespierre saw reflected in his mind a figure at
once more detailed and less human, and one too sharply
defined to be capable of any moulding or of any transference
into the real world. For him this ideal citizen
was nevertheless the one good thing, the one sound basis
of a State. This ideal citizen existed (did men only
know it) in each individual; all men could be made to
approach the type; only a very few were opposed to its
success, and it was a sacred duty to break their criminal
effort. The figure stood ever before him, it dominated
his every thought, it was the sacred thing before which
his essentially mystical mind was perpetually at worship.
But he could see nothing beyond or on either side of it;
concrete impressions faded on the unhealthy retina of
his mind. For there was a mirror held up before his
eyes, and the figure on which he dwelt was himself.</p>

<p>Thus intensely concentrated upon a certain individual
type, it was in his nature to forget the reactions of a
community. He saw in society a few evils prominent,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_287"></a>[287]</span>
authority without warrant, arbitrary rule (that hateful
thing), servility in the oppressed (the main impediment to
any reform). He was blind to the interplay, the organic
quality in a State, which our own time so ridiculously
exaggerates, but which the eighteenth century as a whole
neglected. Rousseau had put admirably the metaphor of
contract as explaining the bond of society. Robespierre,
interpreting him, conceived of contract as the simple and
all-sufficient machinery of a State. The error gave his
attempt a mechanical and an inhuman appearance over
and above its rigidity of dogma. Rousseau, like all the
great writers, gave continual glimpses of the insufficiency
of language; he let his audience see in a hundred phrases,
in a recurrence of qualifications, that his words were no
more than the words of others, hints at realities, at the
best metaphors brought as near as possible to be the true
reflection of ideas. Robespierre read him, and has remained
among the words entangled and satisfied. Rousseau
was perpetually insisting upon a point of view, calling
out, “Come and see.” He had discovered a position from
which (as he thought) the bewildering complexity of
human affairs appeared in a just and simple perspective.
But Rousseau never asserts that such a view will have the
same colouring to all men; on the contrary, at his best
he denies it. He trusts to the main aspect of his theory
for a main result in the State, to an agreement among
men of good-will for the harmonising of conflicting details.
Robespierre, as the high-priest of that gospel, had come
and had seen, but the perfect citizen and the perfect state
of his vision must be realised in every tittle as he had
observed them. Once again a great message was destined
to be sterilised and almost lost through the functionary
of its creed.</p>

<p>Such was the man who had slowly supplanted Danton.
A mind whose type of aberration is common to all nations
had supplanted the typical Frenchman who had organised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_288"></a>[288]</span>
the defence of France, and in the place of one whom his
enemies perpetually reproach with an excess of vigour
and manhood, a theorist of hardly any but intellectual
emotions was master.</p>

<p>What gave him his great ascendancy, his practically
absolute power? It was due, in the first place, to the
popularity whose growth was the feature of the later
Revolution. That popularity was real in the number
of his followers and in the sincerity of their profession.
It must be remembered that hitherto he had stood on
the side of leniency in public action, while in words he
had expressed always accurately, sometimes nobly, the
ideals upon which the nation was bent. He had, from a
constitutional incapacity for real work, been only in the
background of those crises which had left behind them
an increasing crowd of malcontents. Not he, but Danton,
had made the 10th of August. No one had connected
his name with the massacres of September. The necessity
of government was not <i>his</i> interpretation of the
defeats in Belgium; the creation of that government was
another’s; its latent benefits reflect no merit upon him
now; its immediate rigours exposed him to no special
vengeance at the time. Not he, but Marat, is the obvious
demagogue whom the visionary Girondin girl marks out
as the enemy. To Carnot would turn the hatred of those
whom the great conscription oppressed. The Christian
foundation of France had others than Robespierre to
curse for the Masque of Reason and for the suppression
of public worship. He had stood behind Desmoulins
when the reaction of Nivose and Frimaire was at work;
he had approved and was thought the author of that trial
and execution in which Hébert had suffered the sentence
already pronounced upon him by the best of France. In
fact, he had stood in nothing as the extremist or as the
tyrant till the day when he permitted the arrest of
Danton. He had been rather the voice of a strong public<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_289"></a>[289]</span>
opinion than the arm which, when it acts at the orders of
unreason, becomes hated by its own furious master. Thus
upon the negative side there was nothing to prevent his
sudden attainment of power.</p>

<p>In the second place, his name had been the most present
and the most familiar from the earliest days of the
Revolution. He had sat in the Assembly of the Commons
five years before, a notable though hardly a noted
figure, with some stories surrounding him, with quite a
reputation in his provincial centre; he had been, since
first the Jacobin Club became the mouthpiece of the pure
Republicans, the conspicuous leader of the Society. The
force of continuity and tradition counts for little in the
history of this whirlwind, but such as it is it explains to
a great degree the ascendancy of Robespierre. He alone
was never absent, he alone remained to chant a ceaseless
chorus to the action of the drama. His name was familiar
to excess; but it was hardly an epoch at which men grew
weary of hearing a politician called “the just.” Besides
this familiarity with his name, certain virtues—and those
the most cherished of the time—were in fact or by reputation
his. None could accuse him of venality; his sincerity
was obvious—indeed, it was the necessary fruit of
his narrow mind. The ambition from which we cannot
divorce his name was apparent to but few of his contemporaries,
and was not fully seized even by his enemies
till he had started on that short career of absolute power
which has stamped itself for ever upon the fortunes of
his country. Thus habit, the strongest of forces, was
his ally.</p>

<p>In the third place, circumstances quite as much as
his own action had left him (as far as one can follow the
mysteries of the Committee) sole director of an exceptional
executive. On account of the illusions and necessities
of the people such a position was not immediately
recognised as tyrannical. The machine was theirs, working<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_290"></a>[290]</span>
for them and made by them; all the better if an idol
of theirs held the levers; he would make the most trusty
of servants. Robespierre was not master in theory. Even
committees were not the masters in theory. Theory was
everything to France in the year II., and in theory the
Convention was master. Nay, even the Convention was
only master because—in theory again—the sovereign,
the nation, was behind it. The majority of the Convention,
and it alone, is the technical authority. Robespierre’s
name was not to be discovered at the foot of those lists
of the condemned which his monstrous policy constructed,
and at the end of his four months he fell because the
theoretical master, the Convention, acted as it chose, and
no sufficient force dared to deny its right.</p>

<p>He starts then upon the closing act of the play, the
one figure whom all regard, and into whose hands the
police, the committees, the juries, and (by their own disorder)
the majority of the Convention itself have fallen.</p>

<p>The new reign began on the 6th of April, exactly a
year to a day since the Committee of Public Safety had
been established. It was Germinal, the month of
seeds that grow under ground, the most significant and
the most terrible of the new names. M. Zola has chosen
it for the title of his greatest work; it was the other day
on the dying lips of a poor wretch in Spain whose madness
also turned upon social injustice.</p>

<p>The following of Robespierre did not hesitate to show
at once its tendencies and even its dogmas—for it held a
religion. That same day, the 6th of April—17th Germinal
of the year II.—Couthon came from the Committee
with a proposition for the Parliament to discuss the
establishment of a national worship of God. A new note
had been heard in the clamour; soon in the clear silence
of suspense it is to be the only sound, saving the dull
accompaniment of the two guillotines. This or that
occasional freak of theory or dramatised ribaldry the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_291"></a>[291]</span>
Terror had already known; unlimited power defended by
inexorable severity had developed many strange decrees,
dissociated from the general life and dying as they rose—absurdities
whose chief purpose would seem to be the
interest they have afforded to foreigners. But in these
there had been no system. The Mass was being said on
all sides when the churches were supposed to be closed.
Even as the Feast of Reason was being held at Notre
Dame, vespers were chanted at St. Germains. One thing
alone had been the purpose and had given the motive
force to nine months of agony endured—the salvation
of Revolutionary France. But when Couthon spoke it
was not France, nor common rights and liberties which
were proposed as the object of the defence—it was
Robespierrian Rousseau. In two months we shall have
the worship of the Supreme Being, in three the reaction;
in less than four the high-priest of this impossible system
is to fall; yet his dream and his power will be almost
enough in their fall to drag down the Republic.</p>

<p>Five days more saw “the rest of the factions” sacrificed
to this new personal terror. Gobel, who had always
been afraid, and whose conscience had been turned like a
weathercock away from the nearest pike; the wives of
Desmoulins and of Hébert (for women, as the Terror
increased, were suspected, sometimes rightly, of being the
best at plotting); Chaumette, who had helped Hébert to
put up his theatricals in Notre Dame—they were all
tried, and in this trial it is again not the Revolution, but
Robespierre pure and simple whom we hear arguing and
condemning through the mouths of the court.</p>

<p>One of the accused “has wished to efface the idea of
the divinity.” Another has “interfered with the worship
of his fellow-citizens” (this was said to Chaumette, who
must have thought it even at that moment something
of a platitude). To a third the reproach is made of
“changing the mode of worship without authority.” We<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_292"></a>[292]</span>
are on the highroad to those last six weeks in which
trial of any kind and definite accusation itself was absent.
The details of one man’s opinion are become the numberless
dogmas of a creed, and of a creed that kills
unmercifully. And yet even as he asserted his creed its
mechanical impotence appeared in violent contrast with
the humanity that the Puritan was persecuting. For
Lucille lighted her face radiantly when she was condemned,
and said, “I shall see him in a few hours.”</p>

<p>Three days more—the 17th of April—and the
machinery was further centralised. St. Just demanded
that the political prisoners should be taken from every
part of France to be judged in Paris. The popular commissions—mere
gatherings to denounce without proofs
and without forms—were actively used all over the
Republic. In Paris the commission was to be the feeler
for the central machine. And such was the incapacity
of the Dreamer, “who had not wits enough to cook an
egg,” that this new feature in the machinery was not even
organised: it was a government of mere rigid absolutism
resting on bases that were rapidly becoming mere anarchy.
But even as the system, such as it was, developed, as the
central power grew more rigid, and the thing to be
governed more decayed, Danton, who had been killed
that it might exist, pursued it. It was due to his work
that the wrestling on the frontier was showing a definite
issue. The advance had begun.</p>

<p>With his death the diplomacy of France had ceased.
The phrase of Robespierre’s, which he had so successfully
combated, had reappeared in vigour: the “nation would
not treat with her enemies.” But the organisation of her
armies, the levies, the rigid discipline, the arms were telling.
That aspect of the national energy had grown more
healthy as the central brain grew more diseased and vain.
Robespierre was threatening Carnot vaguely in the Committee,
but Carnot was at work and was saving France.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_293"></a>[293]</span>
St. Just himself, when he is upon the frontier, appears in
a capacity worthy of admiration, for he has there to deal
with a thing in action. His energy is as fierce as ever,
but its object is victory over a national enemy, and not
the triumph of a jejune idea. He had better have remained
with the soldiers.</p>

<p>In Paris the Commune had been seized. The enemy
whom all had feared, whom even Danton had to the last
conciliated, was fearlessly grasped. The mayor was broken
simply, and replaced by a servant of the rulers; the
Sections protested with the last of their vitality, but the
Club denounced them, and they disappeared—even an
attempt at martyrdom is to give the idol yet more gilt.
Then the news of Turcoing came to Paris. It was little
more than a happy rumour, a battle whose importance
seems greater to us now than it did to contemporaries.
But Pichegru, the peasant, had prepared a good road for
Jourdan, and Fleurus was the direct result of Turcoing.
Barrère long after called these victories “the Furies,” which
swept upon and destroyed the fanatic in power.</p>

<p>With every point of good news the Terror was less
necessary, yet Robespierre’s action grew as the national
danger disappeared. Even Lord Howe’s great victory of
the 1st of June did little to check the sentiment of relief.
The <i>Vengeur</i> went down and left a force of many
ships to the French navy for ever. The food reached
port, and the eyes of Frenchmen were not directed to the
sea, whose command they knew themselves to have gained
and lost before then with but little resulting change; they
turned, as they have always and will ever turn, to the
frontier of the north-east, the wrestling-ring upon whose
fair level was to be decided the fate of all their sacrifice
and of all their ideals, and Paris every day grew more
hopeful of the result, Robespierre more blind to everything
except his vision. On the 8th of June—the 20th
Prairial—he capped the edifice of his national religion<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_294"></a>[294]</span>
with the Feast of the Supreme Being; on the 10th he
forged the last piece of the machinery which was to make
that religion the moral order of the new era by force.</p>

<p>In the connection of these dates we see the whole
man and the time. Three weeks pass from the first
definite victory against the allies to the law of the 22nd
Prairial. That short time widened the breach between
the armies and the government till it became an impassable
gulf. The fruit of that schism was to appear much
later, but already its elements were clear. Of the two
parts of Danton’s work one had become national, healthy,
representative; the other, which had been designed for
similar action, had finally become a thing of personalities
and of theories. The armies were in full success, the
Terror was menaced, and was doomed.</p>

<p>In this feast of the Almighty, Robespierre was insanely
himself. He wore his bright-blue coat, perhaps to typify
the bright sky which we have all worshipped for so many
thousand years. In his little white hand, that never had
been nor could be put to a man’s work, he held the typical
offerings of fruit and corn. His head was bent forward
a little, and he looked at the ground. The men who stood
up boldly in the attitudes of Mirabeau and of the Tribunes
were dead or in the armies.</p>

<p>Remove the scene by hundreds of years, and tell it
of a primitive people in some mountain valley, it assumes
a simplicity and a grandeur as legend. Their old traditions
(let us say) have been lost or stolen from them.
They are casting about for a lawgiver and for a starting-point.
A pure idealist is found, draconian in his method,
but ascetic and sincere in his life, laying down as necessary
for the state a clear and simple morality, basing all
ethics on the recognition and the worship of God. If we
make that picture we have some idea of what passed
through the mind of the little clique which still surrounded
Robespierre, some conception of the picture which<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_295"></a>[295]</span>
still half-fascinated the crowd. For Robespierre himself
it was intensely true; he lived æons and myriads of
leagues away in time and space from humanity, intent
upon his dream.</p>

<p>But in sight of the mummery stood Notre Dame.
Not a man there but had been baptized in the Christian
faith; a history more complex and more eventful than
that of perhaps any other nation was the inheritance and
the future of that crowd. And even as the game was
being played, the real France on the Sambre and in the
plains of Valenciennes was carrying out the oldest of
struggles in defence of the first of rights. The scene has
been laughed at and despised sufficiently by aliens within
and without the French nation; let it suffice for this book
to insist upon its unreality, and to assert that its principal
actor was genuine because he lived in the unreal.</p>

<p>The law of the 22nd of Prairial followed this feast.
It was the establishment of a pure despotism, arbitrary,
absolute, personal. Already the trials were centralised in
Paris since the demand of St. Just had been made. The
Commune had been captured, the popular commissions
used, even the Presidency of the Convention had become
the appanage of one man and his associates. This
new law proposed the final step. After it was passed the
trials were to be conducted without proofs, and without
witness or pleading, for they were to be nothing more
than a formal process. The Committee once satisfied of
guilt, the tribunal was merely to condemn. To be upon
the lists was virtually to be dead. It was the end of civil
government, the declaration of a state of siege. And that
at the moment when the armies sent every day better and
better news. The Convention debated with Robespierre
in the chair; it hesitated and it nearly condemned the
proposal. There was a conflict in the minds of some
between the admiration—almost the adoration—of a man;
in the minds of others, between fear and the necessity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_296"></a>[296]</span>
apparent to all of relaxing the machinery which only the
national danger had called into being.</p>

<p>Robespierre came down from the chair and spoke.
The even, certain voice which carried away his admirers,
which terrified his opponents, succeeded, and the law was
passed. Those who find it easy to judge the time, who
think it may all be explained by the baseness or the
pusillanimity of the Parliament, should note the appeal
which he made to the <i>Moderates</i> even then—an appeal
which had always been successful, which, when his death
drew near, he made at last (and for the first time) in
vain.</p>

<p>For the Moderates, the Plain, the “Marsh,” saw in him
a kind of saviour, the just man, the slayer of the Mountain,
the master who would be terrible only for a little
time, and would soon restore peace when he had established
a dogma of moral order. Were Moderates ever
slow to give full power for the sake of order?</p>

<p>The next day some one saw that the new law touched
the Parliament itself. Self-defence, the most sacred, perhaps
the only, right of a prince, occurred to them, and
they protested. They passed a resolution that no member
could be taken before the Revolutionary Tribunal without
their consent. The following day Robespierre again
appears, again appeals to the “Marsh.” The men of
order saw at once that no danger applied to them, that
the disorderly fellows up on the benches of the Left alone
were in danger. The resolution was repealed. On that
day, the 24th of Prairial of the year II.—12th of June
1794—the whole of France was at his feet, save the
armies.</p>

<p>The France which had made the Revolution, and
which Danton had loved, defended, and saved, was in the
Ardennes and before Ypres. There were two main bodies.
One, on the left, in the plains by the frontier towns, was
opposed to a united force of English and Austrians; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_297"></a>[297]</span>
other, on the right, in the woods and deep ravines of the
Ardennes, was opposed to a strong series of Austrian posts.
These armies were not separated, but the enemy held the
angle between them. Away on the extreme right Jourdan
held the Moselle valley. Pichegru had come back to the
army of the left, which in his absence had won Turcoing,
and at whose head Soudham, Moreau, and Macdonald had
fought and succeeded. On the right St. Just was throwing
into the attack upon the Sambre all the energy which
had saved, before this, the army of Alsace. Five times
the attempt had been made to pierce the Austrian lines,
and five times it had failed. Coburg lay on both sides
of the river; Charleroy, on the right bank, was his
strong place. The Deputies on mission, St. Just and
Lebas, the same whom we shall see standing by Robespierre
at the end, were present at the last decisive check
before Charleroy itself. With the Sambre thus held, the
southern army was immobilised; the successes of the
army of the north seemed almost valueless, for Coburg
held the angle between the two. Nevertheless, Turcoing
bore great fruit, for it convinced the Austrians that
reinforcements were needed to meet the French advance
in the north. The allies were like a man fighting with a
sword in each hand against two opponents. Wounded in
the right hand, he must cross rapidly with the sword in
his left, and so expose his left side. Thus Coburg left
the Sambre a little more exposed in order to provide temporary
reinforcements against the army that had just
won Turcoing. St. Just and Carnot were enemies; the
young Robespierrian was planned to replace the organiser
whom Danton had recognised; nevertheless, they agreed
at this supreme moment upon the necessary action. St.
Just from the army, Carnot from the Ministry of War at
Paris, called up Jourdan from the Moselle with over forty
thousand men.</p>

<p>They are wrong who imagine that Napoleon invented<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_298"></a>[298]</span>
the attack by concentration on the weakest point; so far
as the large lines of a campaign go he inherited it from
the early Republican generals. Leaving strong places unoccupied,
careless of holding (for example) this position
on the Moselle, the hurried march northward was determined
on, and a supreme effort against the Austrian
lines.</p>

<p>By this junction was formed that “Army of the
Sambre-et-Meuse” which to this day gives a theme for
one of the noblest marching-songs of the French soldiery.
Under Jourdan were men whose names alone have something
of the quality of bugle-calls. Ney, and Kleber, and
Marceau were leading them. There ran through this new
army a kind of prescience, the foreknowledge of victory,
an unaccustomed feeling of expansion and of hope. Soult
speaks of it as his awakening; and there is a fine phrase
in the memoir of a contemporary which gives us some
echo of its enthusiasm: “We always seemed to be marching
into the dawn;” they felt in every rank that the
balance was turning, and that France was to be saved.</p>

<p>A sixth attempt was for a sixth time foiled. The
seventh succeeded. The Austrian line was broken and
Charleroy surrounded; in a week it fell. The capitulation
was hardly achieved when the army of Coburg
appeared to the north-east upon the heights that command
the left bank of the river, a plateau called that of
Fleurus.</p>

<p>It was upon the 25th of June that the armies met
and fought with blazing hay about them and ripe harvest
that had caught fire. Kleber recovered the left wing, as
Cromwell at Naseby, after it had given way. Marceau
obstinately held the right in front of Fleurus, as Davoust
did at Austerlitz ten years later. And towards evening
the watchers in the balloon above the French ranks saw
in regular and stiff retreat the last army of the old world.
By the end of Messidor the English were in Holland, the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_299"></a>[299]</span>
Austrians upon the Rhine, the whole of Belgium was in
the hands of the Republic.</p>

<p>The sun which set upon the death of Danton had
risen again.</p>

<p>So in Robespierre’s own country his fall was prepared
by circumstances. At Arras, his birthplace, one could
almost hear the guns of Fleurus; he and his thin soul
belonged to those plains of the north where the Norman
and the Burgundian, and the Provençal and the Gascon,
born in more generous places, were driving the enemy
before them.</p>

<p>St. Just came back from the front. He at least had
seen on what Revolutionary France was really bent, and
in what she was vigorous. With the superb courage that
belonged to his energy and his youth he had led the
charges. Living with the soldiers, he had seen more
closely, and with more accuracy than is common in
visionaries, the needs of an army. Why did he come
back to continue the insane drama whose seven weeks of
action count more with the enemies of France than all
her centuries?</p>

<p>Because the armies and their victories, though affording
proof of what the nation was and of what it required,
could afford that proof only to a just and even mind. The
soldiers themselves did not express a political opinion;
their whole mind was bent upon the breaking of the line,
the attempt in which they had succeeded. Of Paris, Revolutionary
in the last few months, they knew little. They
judged it as our contemporaries do—on hearsay; and it
seemed to them that there stood in the capital a powerful
Committee full of patriots, who had by an intense, an
almost furious energy, saved them—the soldiers. Men
who risk their lives every day and see death constantly
are not likely to be horror-stricken at an excess of rigour
in government. In their eyes a number of men had
fallen, places had changed, the central power was surrounded<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_300"></a>[300]</span>
by a tumult, but <i>they</i> had been clothed and fed
almost by a miracle—their battles had been made possible.
The year since the great conscription had drawn them
from their homes had been for them a struggle of continual
promise, ending in a great achievement. Already
the soldier was half-professional; the eager volunteer of
1792, full of his politics, had given place to a type which
the wanton policy of the old regime was forging to its
own destruction. For it was forging the veterans who
cared more and more for the Revolutionary thing, and
less and less for the discussions and the theories, till at
last they produced the Empire.</p>

<p>St. Just therefore could not warn Robespierre. St.
Just himself had learnt no lesson. His ideal was still
in his eyes the salvation of France, and even of the
world; the victory of Fleurus only made it the more
possible to carry his ideal out in action. He had seen
the emigrants who were taken in that battle spared for
the first time by the French soldiery, but he did not
recognise the tremendous import of this, nor appreciate
what our own time has thoroughly learnt, that it is the
success or the failure of the national defence which rules
the temper of a nation.</p>

<p>When the news of Fleurus became known in Paris
the law of Prairial had been in action for nearly three
weeks. By the time the victory and its meaning had
fully sunk into the mind of the capital half the short
period of Robespierre had expired. How much was due
to fear upon his part, how much to mere blindness, we
cannot tell, but the very moment when the necessity for
the Terror patently disappeared was the moment chosen
by him for the aggravation of his system.</p>

<p>He attacked the Mountain.</p>

<p>It will be remembered that the Convention had feared
for itself when it gave the full power into his hands. On
the 11th of June Bourdon from the Oise had carried a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_301"></a>[301]</span>
motion which would have defended the deputies, but
which Robespierre had caused to be cancelled upon the
following day.</p>

<p>With an attack, however, appearing as a reality
instead of remaining as a threat, even the “Marsh” grew
afraid. He put into his speech an excellent maxim, that
“not success of armies abroad or on the frontier are the
greatness of a nation, but the virtue of its private citizens
within” (21st Messidor)—a truth appearing perhaps at
the very worst moment, for it translated itself at once
in the minds of his audience into “the victories mean
nothing to me; the guillotine is for the defence not of the
nation but of my dogmas.” And his faith went on sacrificing
its innumerable victims.</p>

<p>Another and a final element was added to the forces
against him. The Committee began to refuse his leadership.
It must be remembered that Robespierre was not
absolute master in the sense in which (for example) an
English general would be master of an Indian province
after the suppression of a mutiny. Circumstances, immense
popularity, above all the kind of men who composed
the great Committee, are the explanation of his
power. His power was a fact, but a fact based on no
theoretical right, and therefore possessed of no elements
of endurance. Even the Committee was in the eyes of
all the governed, and of some of its own members, only
the servant of the national welfare. Two men upon it
were Robespierrians—Couthon and St. Just; one was a
turncoat by nature—Barrère; two more were men of the
Hébertian type, most unreliable for an idealist to deal
with—Billaud and Collot. Finally there remains Carnot,
the worker, and four others—the two Prieurs, Lindet
and St. André.</p>

<p>Robespierre could be virtually a master, but a master
only on the tolerance of superior though latent force.
He could inspire terror by the common knowledge that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_302"></a>[302]</span>
the machinery was in his hands, that its terrible punishment
was practically his to inflict at pleasure. But
something put it into his hand, and something could
take it away. It cannot be too often repeated, if we
wish to understand the Revolution, that from the fall
of Lafayette to the 13th of October 1795 there was no
disciplined armed force at the service of the Government,
there was nobody better armed or better drilled
than the man in the street—not even gunners, the first
necessity of modern masters, for the very artillery was
amateur; above all, there was no armed body whose
members obeyed without question, who were, as a good
army must be, a rigid instrument of government framed
upon a device which multiplies a hundredfold the strength
of each man in the public service. The “strong men”
of history, whom our reactionaries delight to honour,
have always had such an instrument at their disposition,
but when there is no one to fire at a command, your
strong man is like any other, save that he is a little
weaker for shouting.</p>

<p>What then was the ultimate master which permitted
Robespierre to rule? It was composed of several forces,
and in its division is to be found the secret of its
inertia.</p>

<p>Firstly, the Convention, mutilated as it was, was
granted by all to be the nearest representative of the
nation. What the majority voted was done. It exercised
a very great moral influence, and if it had shown that
influence so slightly, it was because its organisation was
contemptible—a mass of individuals, with no traditions
of action or of grouping, a crowd in which the fear
of each that another might be his enemy caused the
sum of its individual cries to be anything but the integrate
expression of its corporate will. Well, this crowd
had had one formidable enemy. The <i>right</i> of the Convention
had been combated by the <i>force</i> of the well-organised<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_303"></a>[303]</span>
Commune. The Commune used to be a mirror
of at least half of Paris; it had lost this character. It
was nothing now but a group of Robespierrians, and the
Convention was the stronger for the change.</p>

<p>Secondly, there was the material force—the populace
of Paris. They had not risen hitherto save for one or
two motives—the establishment of the national defence,
the prevention of a political reaction; and they had been
more turbulent and more dangerous where the first than
where the second was their cause for action.</p>

<p>Thirdly, the regular initiative was in the hands of
a majority of the Committee of Public Safety.</p>

<p>The moment therefore that the majority of the Committee
refused to follow Robespierre’s lead, he would have
had to ascend the tribune of the Convention, and in one
of those speeches which carried to some such genuine
conviction, but to many others such still more genuine
fear, he would have had to obtain a majority for the
reconstruction of the great Committee.</p>

<p>Now a deliberative Assembly which is not strictly
organised upon party lines, which has no aristocratic
quality and no great (because traditional) corporate pride,
is very strongly influenced by what we call “Public
Opinion.” It hears reports from the whole nation, is
composed of every kind of man, regards itself moreover
as in duty bound to listen to the voices outside, meets
in its lobbies and during its recesses every species of
expression.</p>

<p>Such a jury is therefore the very worst before which
a popular idol could present itself when some strong
adverse action had just shown his reputation to be falling.
Outvoted in Committee, condemned in Parliament, the
man who had but just now been supreme would have
to turn to whatever he could find of physical force to
support him.</p>

<p>But that physical force in the case of Robespierre<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_304"></a>[304]</span>
was only the populace of Paris, and a populace moreover
whose one organising centre—the Commune—had been
weakened by himself. Once suppose him forced to
depend upon a rising of the people, and the weakness of
his position is apparent; even were he still the politician
of the majority, it would be a long step from approving
of his policy to risking one’s life in a civil tumult, conscious
that one was attacking every form of constituted
authority, and presumably the opinion of the whole
nation, for no principle, from no necessity, but to save
a man. As we shall see, the rising to defend him comprised
but a small knot of men, and totally failed.</p>

<p>The man who had not the wits to cook an egg
prepared his own ruin. Carnot, whose one idea was to
work and save the frontier, he openly menaced. Robespierre
meditated the inconceivable folly of replacing
Carnot’s science by the blind activity of St. Just. In
alienating Carnot and losing that possible ally, Robespierre
lost five of his colleagues on the Committee. The end of
Messidor saw him in a kind of voluntary isolation, letting the
fatal machine work on, while he stood off from the levers.</p>

<p>He seems to have just felt two doubts disturbing the
serenity of his fanatical complacency. First, whether
after all he was going down to posterity as he saw himself
to be—the maker of a new France, “the terror of
oppressors and the refuge of the oppressed.” (One day
his eyes filled when the noise of the tumbrils reached
him, and he said, “I shall be remembered only as a slayer
of men.” So wrapped up in himself, he had not yet
heard an echo of what all men were saying.) Secondly,
he wondered whether his perfect state was so near as he
had thought. The killing went on, and he got no nearer.
The “anti-patriots,” the “anti-revolutionaries,” the “anti-Robespierres”
(though he did not think of them so)
passed perpetually eastward and westward daily from
the prisons to the two guillotines.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_305"></a>[305]</span></p>

<p>By the irony of whatever rules and laughs at men,
events caused the first mutterings to rise among the
Extremists. The Terror was too mild, and above all the
men with hearts of beasts—the remainder of the Hébertists—hated
a policy which included, however fantastically,
the ideal and the worship of God. They hated his half-alliance
with whatever was Christian in the Convention,
and his perpetual appeals to the Moderates.</p>

<p>The Lower Committee had a partially independent life.
It was known to be the policy of Robespierre to submit
this body, as he had submitted all the other organs of
government, to the great Committee of Public Safety.
Hence it was in this Lower Committee of General Security—menaced
as a function and as individuals, thoroughly
in touch, by its position, with the police—that the conspiracy
arose. The majority of its members joined it, and
from the Higher Committee Billaud and Collot adhered.
On the 7th of Thermidor (25th of July 1794) the storm
burst. Barrère read his report to the Convention, and it
was an open menace to Robespierre.</p>

<p>The origins of that report merit a certain discussion.
We have seen that from the first the reports, directed by
the Committee, were usually written by Barrère, and were
read to the Convention by him. On the other hand, we
can discover usually in the style, and always in the
opinions of the reports, the action of whoever led in the
councils of the Committee. Thus, in the document of
this nature of which so much mention is made in chapter
vi., the spirit, and evidently many of the actual phrases,
are the work of Danton.</p>

<p>Who drew up Barrère’s report, whether (possibly) it
was his own work, when he saw opinion shifting away from
Robespierre, or whether, as is more probable, it was inspired
by Billaud and Collot, and permitted by the five
neutrals, we cannot tell. The main fact is this, that the
Committee had at least permitted to be made in its name<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_306"></a>[306]</span>
a public declaration hostile to the man who, through the
Committee, had ruled France.</p>

<p>The report repudiated in detail the policy of the past
seven weeks; it insisted on the importance of the victories,
on the iniquity of further lists of victims. For
the first time in four months the Convention acted
freely; it ordered the report to be printed and to be sent
to all the Communes of France.</p>

<p>On the next day Robespierre came for the last time
into his accustomed place. He gave his last speech to
the Parliament. He was to appear once more, but never
again as the orator and the leader. Reading, as was his
wont, not declaiming, in the slow even voice that had
compelled such attention, such enthusiasm, and such fear,
he made the last of his declarations. This speech, if no
other, should be read to understand the man. Here
a theory stated with power and with precision; there a
description of those without whose condemnation the
theory could not be realised. A noble ideal based upon
the scaffold; a dogma and a detailed persecution side by
side. He read it slowly from end to end, proving to
himself, and, as he thought, to his audience, the perfection
of his ideal, and the necessity of the terrible road towards
it. But his audience heard nothing of the ideal; they
heard only the description of themselves.</p>

<p>Men of all kinds, the mere demagogues, were in that
summary, the personal enemies, the financiers. It seems
that on the manuscript from which he read even Cambon’s
name was written. But in this extreme crisis, when he
was denouncing the first men in order to save his
own position, he was no longer Robespierre. It made
no difference to his fate, yet we judge him with more
accuracy when we know that he omitted the name of
Cambon, and that he did not pronounce that of Carnot,
whom he had threatened in private. It was an attempt
at compromise.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_307"></a>[307]</span></p>

<p>The Convention heard him and his threat. Of his
theories they had heard enough for years. Yet such was
the power of his slow clear utterance, of the reverence
which his following commanded, and of the idea which he
expressed so well, and in which all at heart believed, that
they voted the printing and the dissemination of the
speech. Cambon and Billaud-Varennes rose to demand
the repeal of the vote. The great unwieldy assembly, or
rather its great unwieldy neutral faction, hesitated, conferred,
and yielded to the demand. Then Robespierre
was doomed.</p>

<p>As he was reading, as the distribution of the speech
and then its repeal were being voted, there hung above his
head and that of the Parliament the flags taken in
the new victories from the English and Austrians at Turcoing,
at Landrecies, at Quesnoy, at Condé, at Valenciennes,
at Fleurus, and it was they that turned the scale.</p>

<p>When the evening came the Club met, the little
society of the Jacobins, which was still the most independent
and the most vital force in Paris. It had dared to
elect a president for its debates whose whole policy was
antagonistic to Robespierre; yet now it heard him and
remembered its old idol. He re-read, in the same tone,
but in a more familiar surrounding and with ampler
diction, the speech of the morning, and his hearers grew
wild with enthusiasm. They hissed and they turned out
Billaud and Collot, who had dared to be present; they
cried out to Robespierre that they would follow him
always towards the perfect Republic; and David, an excellent
artist and a bad man, cried to him from the back,
“I will drink the hemlock with you!” but he was afraid
even to acknowledge his master when Robespierre came
to die.</p>

<p>The Jacobins that night were ready to rise for Robespierre.
As so many minorities have been in that city of
convictions and of intense enthusiasms, they were ready to<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_308"></a>[308]</span>
impose themselves and their creed upon the capital and
upon France; but they did not know to what a handful
they had been reduced in the last seven weeks. All night
the conspiracy against Robespierre worked hard. Boissy
D’Anglas, the leader of the “Marsh,” was brought over. To
him and his followers Robespierre was pointed out as
the tyrant; to what was left of the Mountain he was
denounced as the moderate and the compromiser. But,
above all, he was, to the great bulk of the Convention, the
enemy who had destroyed all civil order in pursuit of his
mad theories, and who had even held the victories of no
account.</p>

<p>The Parliament met the next morning, on the 9th of
Thermidor (27th of July). It was a year to a day since
Robespierre had joined the great Committee; but it was
for the condemnation of Robespierre that they met. The
great hall waited for a coming tumult. First into the
tribune went St. Just, with his beautiful face and strong
bearing, determined in oratory as in the battles to strike
at once and lead a charge. He was eloquent, for he was
trying to save his friend; he boldly attempted argument,
a compromise, anything; called it “saving the Republic.”
“Let us end his domination if you will, but let the
government still be that of the Revolution, and let
us draw up such rules as shall save us from arbitrary
power without destroying the motive force of the national
demand.” The sentiment was precisely that of the Convention,
but the speaker was known to be merely the
young bodyguard of their enemy.</p>

<p>Tallien called out from the right, “Pull back the
curtain,” and, though the fellow was an actor, he
had struck the right note. St. Just could never defend
Robespierre; it would have been a cloak for continuing
the Terror. The Convention applauded, and from applause
turned to crying down St. Just in a public roar of
fear and hatred.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_309"></a>[309]</span></p>

<p>Then twice Robespierre tried to speak; the hubbub
silenced him. During a lull in the storm they voted
the arrest of Henriot. It meant the transference of such
pitiful armed force as he commanded from the hand of
a friend to that of an enemy. Robespierre made a last
effort to rescind that order. He was not heard.</p>

<p>Tallien was given the tribune by the Speaker (Collot
was Speaker that day, and Collot had been turned out by
the Jacobins the night before). Tallien spoke theatrically,
as he always did, but to the point. Robespierre, he
said, had plotted to destroy the assembly for his purposes;
he quoted the speech of the day before. While
Barrère, the turncoat, stood looking this way and that,
not knowing how things would turn. Once more Robespierre
attempted a reply; he only raised a storm that
drowned his voice.</p>

<p>When he saw that full speech was denied him, he
turned from the place where he stood towards the
“Marsh,” the Moderates, and said, “I appeal to you who
are just and who are not conspiring with these assassins;”
but the “Marsh” was lost to him—they also cried him
down.</p>

<p>A little silence followed. They saw Robespierre
attempting for a fifth time to speak, but the agony of
the night and the fearful struggle of the morning had
overcome him at last: his voice could not be heard
though he tried to articulate. Garnier of the Aube
called to him across the floor of the hall, “The blood
of Danton chokes you.” It was the truest thing said in
that wild meeting.</p>

<p>Before the silence was broken, Louchet, an unknown
man, rose and proposed the arrest, saying openly what
all thought: “No one will deny that Robespierre has
played the master; let us vote his arrest.” Then Robespierre
found his voice. He went up four steps above
his usual seat, to a place where, high up and from the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_310"></a>[310]</span>
left, from the summit of what had been the Mountain in
the old days, he could see the whole of that multitudinous
assembly, with whose aid he had hoped to regenerate
France and to save mankind. Beneath him as a
host, like the dim pictures of Martin’s Milton, rank on
rank, he saw so many heads that it must have seemed
to him a nation. He remembered all his dreams of a
perfect state, of men living in equality, with no one
oppressed and no one oppressing, of a government based
upon the clear will of all, and upon the civic virtues
which he had preached, till there should rise the perfect
Republic, an exemplar for all the nations. He saw that
he was doomed, and with him all his dreams. Perhaps,
also, he saw the armed despotism which he had twice
prophesied coming in his place. To the last he did not
understand his folly, and he replied to the demand of
Louchet, “Vote for my death.”</p>

<p>Le Bas, who had been with St. Just in the Ardennes,
who had helped to make the great army of Sambre-et-Meuse,
and Robespierre the younger, another honest man,
came and did what David failed to do—they said they
would die with him, and took his hands in theirs. The
Committee passed to the vote, and the three were taken
away with St. Just and with Couthon. The scene that
follows is the end of the Revolution in Paris.</p>

<p>Twice at least in the course of the preceding five
years Paris had risen against the law and had removed
an obstacle or a man for the sake of the Revolution.
The random Municipality of 1789 (which for all its disorder
was the parent of the puissant modern system of
Communes) is an example in point; the 2nd of June is
another. Ultimately the people of Paris were the only
force on which government rested, and it was to them
that the final appeal was made.</p>

<p>The Commune possessed the initiative in this matter—it
was the sole centre of Paris in theory; and now that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_311"></a>[311]</span>
the clubs were all in decay (save the Jacobins), now that
the great orators were exiled or dead, and that the Sections
themselves did not meet, the Commune was also
the only centre in fact. But the Commune, it will be
remembered, had become a Robespierrian thing. It
determined to rise against the Convention.</p>

<p>The Convention had ordered the arrest of Henriot,
who was commander of the armed force (such as it was)
of the town. It sent his successor, Hesmart to do the
work. But the head of a number of pikes and guns
would not submit to a man who represented only the
law, and instead of Hesmart arresting Henriot, it was
Henriot who arrested Hesmart.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the other officers of the Commune displayed
the same energy, the same rapidity of execution
and design which under better leaders and for a better
cause had hitherto succeeded. Lescot-Payot (the Robespierrian
mayor who had been put into the place of Pache
on the 21st of Floréal), and Payan the national agent,
were at the head of the movement. They sent orders to
the prisons to refuse the arrested deputies, they gave
Henriot the formal order to employ his full force and
act. They raised the Jacobins. They formed a committee
of nine who were to take over the government;
they ordered the arrest of their principal enemies in the
Convention, and most important of all, they convened the
Sections.</p>

<p>They had only a night to work in—the 9th Thermidor
to the 10th—and <i>their</i> work had the energy of a
fever; but the greatest factor of all was lacking—the fever
did not spread. The inertia of the people, even their
disapproval, was evident as they proceeded; the majority
of such Sections as did meet stood aloof from or condemned
the cause of Robespierre.</p>

<p>While it was still just light, between eight and nine in
the evening, Robespierre, whom the keepers of the Luxemburg<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_312"></a>[312]</span>
prison had refused, was brought to the Mairie, and
there one after the other all the arrested deputies came,
profiting by the official routine; for the Mairie was the
“right place” officially for prisoners when a difficulty
arose as to imprisonment within Paris. But official
routine had a strange bedfellow that night, for while the
officials took the prisoners there, the small band of rebels,
who knew of no place more friendly, brought there also
those whom they had delivered by force. Robespierre
was again with the strongest of his friends—his brother,
St. Just, Couthon; he was surrounded by an organised
and legal body, the Commune, which had risen in his
defence; they passed to the Hotel de Ville, and outside,
on the Place de Grève, there gathered between ten o’clock
and eleven a fairly large group of the National Guard.
But there was no order among them, nor any accurate
knowledge among their officers as to what was to be done.
From the windows of the room where Robespierre and
his companions sat, there could be dimly seen a moving
crowd of mingled citizens and guards, discussing rather
than preparing for action.</p>

<p>Robespierre refused to put himself at the head of the
movement; at least it is only thus that we can explain
the delay and the confusion. He was to the last the
strange mixture of lawyer and pedant and idealist. He
would not act without the legal right, for his pedantry
forbade it, nor move with an armed minority, because,
judged by his theories, it would have been a crime. Perhaps
at the very last he decided to move: there exists a
document authorising a march on the Convention, and at
its base the first three letters of his name—the signature
unfinished, interrupted.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the Convention had found a new energy
and a power of corporate action to which it had been long
a stranger—each man there was defending his life. Legendre,
with a small force, went and closed the Jacobins.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_313"></a>[313]</span>
Barras was given the command of such armed men as
could be gathered; the two committees sent emissaries
who appealed with success to the Sections. The Convention
was the law which had always meant so much
to the people; it was the authority of the constitution.
Its majority, obeyed when it was in lethargy,
could not but be successful when it awoke. All Paris
defended it.</p>

<p>At midnight one of the sudden thunder-showers which
are common in the Seine valley at that season cleared
what was left of the crowd before the Hotel de Ville.
They had discussed both sides, and they had not decided—hardly
an army for rebellion; they had doubted what
business they had there, and with the rain they went
home. Yet it was not till two hours after, in the early
morning, that the little band of the Convention came into
the square. They found it almost empty, with here and
there a small group standing on the wet cobble-stones,
sleepy but curious.</p>

<p>Bourdon and a few policemen went into the Hotel de
Ville and found no defenders. They went up to the room
where the conspirators sat.</p>

<p>Robespierre was on the ground with his jaw broken by
a pistol-shot.</p>

<p>At half-past seven in the evening of that day (the
10th Thermidor) twenty-two of the Robespierrians were
taken in three carts to the guillotine. Robespierre himself,
half-unconscious from his wound, stood propped
against the side of the cart, his head bandaged, his arms
bound, his chin upon his breast. Ropes also bound his
body to the sides of the tumbril. He passed the house
where Duplay had sheltered him, and where he had hidden
himself, so as not to hear the noise of the executioners’
carts. Now beneath him the heavy wheels were making
the same sound on the ruts of the Rue St. Honoré. At
a cross-street the cart stopped to let pass the funeral of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_314"></a>[314]</span>
Madame Aigué, who had killed herself the day before from
fear of Robespierre.</p>

<p>As they neared the Place of the Revolution, where
Louis and Danton had suffered, probably at the turning
of the Rue St. Honoré, where the guillotine came in sight
and where Danton had sung his song, a woman came forward
from the crowd—doubtless some one whom his
tyranny had directly bereaved—and struck Robespierre a
blow. For sixteen hours he had not spoken nor made a
sign, but when he felt through this blow the popular
hatred, he made a gesture of contempt and of despair;
he shrugged his shoulders, but kept his innumerable
thoughts within the bandages. “<i>De mourir pour le peuple
et d’en être abhorré</i>.”</p>

<p class="tb">Then—so the greatest of French historians tell us—France
marched down a broad road to the tomb where
she has left two millions of men.</p>

<p>But the armies of the great twenty years cannot be
stated in the terms of one man’s ambition, nor summed
up in any of the simple formulæ which a just hatred of
Cæsarism has framed to explain them. At the root of
every battle of the Empire was the organisation and the
enthusiasm of 1793. The tactics of Austerlitz and of
Jena were learned in Flanders; the enthusiasm of the
Guard itself came in clear descent from the exaltation of
the Sambre-et-Meuse.</p>

<p>In this book we have attempted to judge the first man
of a great crisis in relation to his time; it is still more
essential that, when we consider the after-effects of his
action, a whole nation under arms should stand in the
right historical framework, its gigantic effort part and
parcel of a supreme necessity.</p>

<p>We can understand, we can speak rationally, and therefore
truly, of Danton, when we show him above all loving
and defending France and the Revolutionary Thing: that<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_315"></a>[315]</span>
same appreciation will make us follow clearly the continuous
development of his action. It is hardly too much
to say that, until Tilsit, the French had to advance or be
crushed—nation, creed, and men.</p>

<p>The men and the armies must be for us the men and
the armies that gave a new vigour to Europe; the details
of their action should not be the matter of our judgment,
but their relation to the whole community—its needs, its
defence, its faith.</p>

<p>As the time grows greater between that period and our
own, a just proportion imposes itself. The flame which,
close at hand, burnt in a formless furnace is beginning to
assume a certain shape. From a standpoint so distant
that no living memory bridges the gulf, we can measure
the light, the heat, and even the fuel of that flame.</p>

<p>As to its final meaning in our society, every day makes
that clearer; and, to change the metaphor, this much becomes
more and more apparent, that through whatever
crises the Western civilisation is to pass, and whatever form
its edifice will finally take, when the noise of the building
is over, the corner-stone, with its immense strength and its
precision of line, was planned by the philosophy and was
hewn by the force of the Revolution. Civilisations die, and
ours was dying before that wind swept across Europe.</p>

<p>It would have been a poor excuse for leaving unremoved
the rubble, the dust, and the putrescence of the old
world to have pleaded that the decay was the action of
centuries, and that old things alone were worthy of reverence.
Old things alone are worthy of reverence, but old
things which have grown old upon just and sure foundations,
to which time has added ornament and the satisfaction
of harmonious colour, without destroying the main
lines, and without sapping the strength by which they
live.</p>

<p>The new foundations alone stand at the present day.
They are crude, they satisfy nothing in us permanently,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_316"></a>[316]</span>
they are very far from affording that sentiment of content
which is the first requisite of a happy civilisation. But
time will do in this case, as it has always done in every
other, the work of harmony and of completion. The final
society will not be without its innumerable complexity of
detail, its humour, and its inner life. Certainly it will not
long remain a stranger to the unseen; but it will be built
upon 1793.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the light grows on the origins. The personal
bitterness which the struggle produced has passed.
It is a pious memory in this or that family in France to
give itself still the name of a Revolutionary faction; but
the hatred that has produced confusion in honest critics,
and that has furnished such ample material for false history,
that hatred is disappearing in France. The vendettas
have ceased, and the grosser of the calumnies are
no longer heard. The history of the Revolution began to
be possible when Louis Blanc sat down to curse the upheaval
that had killed his father, and ended by producing
the work which more than any other exalted the extreme
Revolutionary ideal.</p>

<p>The story of that time is now like a photographic
negative, which a man fixes, washing away the white
cloud from the clean detail of the film. Point after
point, then more rapidly whole spaces, stand out precise
and true. And the certitude which he feels that the
underlying picture is an accurate reminiscence of Nature
comes to us also when we make out and fix some passage in
the Revolution, cleared of its mass of hearsay, of vituperation,
of ignorance, and of mere sound.</p>

<p>We are beginning to see a great picture, consonant in
its details, and consecutive in its action. The necessity of
reform; the light of the ideal striking men’s minds after a
long sleep, the hills first and afterwards the plains; privilege
and all the interests of the few alarmed and militant;
the menace of attack and the preparation of defence; the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_317"></a>[317]</span>
opposition of extremes on either side of the frontier, growing
at an increasing speed, till at last, each opposite
principle mutually exciting the other, as armatories their
magnets, from a little current of opinion rose a force that
none could resist. The governments of the whole world
were for the destruction of the French people, and the
French people were for the rooting out of everything,
good and evil, which was attached, however faintly, to the
old regime.</p>

<p>The rhetoricians passed in the smoke of the fire, unsubstantial,
full of words that could lead and inspire, but
empty of acts that could govern the storm. From their
passing, which is as vague as a vision, we hear faintly the
“Marseillaise” of the Girondins.</p>

<p>The men of action and of the crisis passed. They
burnt in the heat they themselves had kindled, but in
that furnace the nation was run, and forged, and made.
Then came the armies: France grown cold from the casting-pit,
but bent upon action, and able to do.</p>

<p>Wherever France went by, the Revolutionary Thing
remained the legacy of her conviction and of her power.
It remains with a kind of iron laughter for those who
judge the idea as a passing madness. The philosophers
have decided upon a new philosophy; the lawyers have
clearly proved that there has been no change; the rhetoric
has been thoroughly laughed down, enthusiasm has grown
ridiculous, and the men of action are cursed. But in the
wake of the French march citizens are found who own the
soil and are judged by an equal code of laws; nationalities
have been welded, patriotism has risen at the call of the
new patriotic creed; Germany, Austria, Hungary, Bohemia,
Italy have known themselves as something more than the
delimitations of sovereigns. Nor was there any abomination
of the old decay, its tortures, its ignominies, its
privileges, its licensed insults, or its slaveries, but she
utterly stamped them out. In Germany, in Austria, in<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_318"></a>[318]</span>
Italy, they disappeared. Only in one dark corner they
remained—the great Northern field, where France herself
grew powerless from cold, and from whence an unknown
rule and the advance of relentless things menaces Europe
now.</p>

<p>But with the mention of that frozen place there comes
a thought older than all our theories—the mourning for
the dead. Danton helped to make us, and was killed:
his effort has succeeded, but the tragedy remains. The
army at whose source he stood, the captain who inherited
his action, were worn out in forging a new world. And I
will end this book by that last duty of mourning, as we
who hold to immortality yet break our hearts for the
dead.</p>

<p>There is a legend among the peasants in Russia of a
certain sombre, mounted figure, unreal, only an outline
and a cloud, that passed away to Asia, to the east and to
the north. They saw him move along their snows
through the long mysterious twilights of the northern
autumn in silence, with the head bent and the reins in
the left hand loose, following some enduring purpose,
reaching towards an ancient solitude and repose. They
say it was Napoleon. After him there trailed for days
the shadows of the soldiery, vague mists bearing faintly
the forms of companies of men. It was as though the
cannon-smoke of Waterloo, borne on the light west wind
of that June day, had received the spirits of twenty years
of combat, and had drifted farther and farther during the
fall of the year over the endless plains.</p>

<p>But there was no voice and no order. The terrible
tramp of the Guard and the sound that Heine loved, the
dance of the French drums, was extinguished; there was
no echo of their songs, for the army was of ghosts and
was defeated. They passed in the silence which we can
never pierce, and somewhere remote from men they sleep
in bivouac round the most splendid of human swords.</p>

<span class="smaller">NOTE ON THE CORDELIERS</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The spot once occupied by the Cordeliers is among the most interesting
in Paris, and it is of some importance to sketch its
history and to reconstruct its appearance at greater length than
was possible in the text.</p>

<p>All the land from St. Germains des Près up northwards along
the hillside had belonged to that abbey since its foundation,
when the first dynasty of Frankish kings had endowed the
foundation with a great estate carved out of what had once been
the Roman fiscal lands on the south bank. Round the abbey
itself a few houses had gathered, forming the “Faubourg” (or
suburb) of “St. Germains”; but the greater part of the estate was
open field and meadow. When Philip Augustus built his great
wall round Paris it cut through the estate, leaving the Church
and Abbey of St. Germains outside the city, but enclosing a small
part of the fields within its boundary.</p>

<p>You may trace the line of the wall at this day by noting the
street “Rue de Monsieur le Prince,” once called “Rue des Fossés
Monsieur le Prince,” and running on the line of the outer ditch.
The wall ran not twenty yards east of the modern street and
exactly parallel to it. A portion of it may yet be seen in that
neighbourhood, a great hollow round built into the wall of one
of the houses, a cobbler’s shop in the Cour du Commerce; it is
one (the last, I believe) of the half-towers which flanked Philip
Augustus’s wall.</p>

<p>In the beginning of the thirteenth century, very shortly after
the death of St. Francis, the first preachers of the new Order<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_322"></a>[322]</span>
which he had founded came to Paris. It was the moment when
the University was climbing up the hill, building its colleges,
having possessed its charter for some years, and already a strong,
organised, wealthy, and therefore conservative body. This order
of preachers, wandering, intensely new, and founded by a mystic
whose place in Christendom was not yet finally determined, were
bound to come into collision with the spirit of the place. It
must be remembered that the thirteenth century was not transitional,
but, on the contrary, a time of settled order. For a
century it had known the Roman law; it had everywhere the
Gothic architecture; it had systemised and made legal the rough
accidents of feudal custom; it was wealthy, proud, and successful.
On it there falls one of those creations which are only possible in
a time of energy, and yet which almost invariably quarrel with
the period that has produced them. An Order devoted to simplicity,
making of holy poverty the foundation of the inner life,
specially created for the poor (whom the growing differentiation
of society was beginning to debase), the early Franciscans were
essentially revolutionary, because they built on the great foundations
of all active and permanent reform—I mean the appetite for
primitive conditions, and the determination to break through the
net of complexity which the long growths of time weave about a
conservative society.</p>

<p>The rich Abbey of St. Germains gave them asylum. It was
proud to possess dependants, it was great enough to afford benevolent
experiments, and it took pleasure in offending the University,
which was an upstart in its eyes, and was beginning to show
as a powerful rival in the affairs of the south side of Paris. The
Franciscans, therefore—whom the populace already called the
“Cordeliers” from the girdle of rope about their habit—were
permitted to settle in that little corner of their estate which had
been cut off by the building of the town wall, and they occupied
a triangle of which the wall formed the south-western, a lane
(afterwards called “Rue des Cordeliers”) the northern, and an
irregular line bounding one of the University estates the south-eastern
side.</p>

<p>This was in 1230. St. Louis was still a boy of fifteen. The
little foundation was, for the University, nothing but an unwelcome
neighbour whom it could not oust, and for the Abbey of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_323"></a>[323]</span>
St. Germains nothing but a guest. Their provisional tenure did
not permit them a peal of bells nor a public cemetery.</p>

<p>St. Louis, however, grew into a manhood which, for all its
piety, had a wonderful grasp of the society around it. The saint
who was never clerical, and the Capetian who in all things was
rather for the spirit than the letter, became their principal support.
The Papacy, having once (though reluctantly) recognised
the Franciscan movement in the interview between Innocent III.
and its founder, continued in the succeeding generation to protect
it. From a distance, where the quarrels of the University affected
it little, the Holy See decided more than one dispute in favour of
the new-comers, and the Franciscans of Paris flourished exceedingly.
By 1240 the full privileges of an independent foundation
were granted. They have their public service, their cemetery,
and their bells. St. Louis helps them to build a new chapel by
giving them, in 1267, part of the great fine which he levied on
Enguerrand de Coucy. They succeed at last in obtaining the
recognition of the University; they are permitted to teach; they
number among their lecturers Duns Scotus and St. Bonaventure;
and they become one of the most famous of the colleges.</p>

<p>During the Middle Ages (apart from certain minor structures
and a few private houses which had been permitted to rise on
their land, and which were technically known as the “dépendances”),
three principal groups of buildings marked the foundations.
First, the monastery itself, a somewhat irregular mass,
running (as a whole) north and south, and separated from the
Rue des Cordeliers by a little court or garden. Secondly, running
from the northern end of this convent, and forming, as it were, a
letter L with the main building, was the chapel, lying, of course,
east and west, and forming the southern side of the Rue des
Cordeliers, upon which was the principal porch. Thirdly, running
also east and west, but separated from the other buildings by
a short space, was the hall.</p>

<p>This famous monument, the only part of the college that has
been preserved, stood well back from the street, and in the middle
of the convent grounds. It was on the eastern side of the monastery,
and hence in the ground plan balanced (so to speak) the
church, which lay to the west of that main building; this was so
designed that its western end faced about the middle of the college.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_324"></a>[324]</span></p>

<p>I have called it a hall because its use exactly corresponded to
that of our college halls in the English universities. I mean, it
was at once a refectory and lecture-room. It was approached by
a little lane running up through the grounds under the side of the
convent, later hemmed in with houses.</p>

<p>Here not only were the voices of the great scholars heard and
the subtleties of the fourteenth century, but also Etienne Marcel
called the States General of 1357. From hence that Danton of
the mediæval invasion sent out his messengers to the Feudality.
Here the District gathered for the elections of 1789; here the
Club met in 1791 and urged the debate that finally produced the
Republic of the next year. It was here also that the three watchwords
of the Republic were devised; here Hérbert veiled the
Declaration; and here the last few words of 1794 were spoken.
Here the century, which owes more perhaps to that site than to
any place in France, has collected a museum of surgery, where you
may see anomalies preserved in spirits, skeletons hung on wires,
and other objects, interesting rather than sublime.</p>

<p>As for the college and its estate, they continued for some three
hundred years—that is, during the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth
centuries—to increase in importance. It is a matter of
common knowledge how soon the pure ideals of St. Francis had
to compromise with the world. This Order, like all others, became
wealthy, rooted, and traditional. The Cordeliers, as Paris grew,
found themselves possessed of a most valuable plot, whose ground-value
continually increased. They reserved the garden to the
west, but for the rest—and especially around the buildings and
along the lanes—houses were built. When the wall of Philip
Augustus was first embedded by the growth of the city, and
afterwards in part destroyed, the Cordeliers bought an extension
to their estate, so that it stretched a little beyond the new street
of “the Fossés,” which had been built on the site of the ditch.
In 1580 their old thirteenth-century chapel (which must have
been one of the best bits of early Gothic in Paris) was burnt
down, and a larger one in the style of the time was put up by the
piety of Henry IV. Throughout the seventeenth century the
house seems to have suffered from a decay which continued
throughout the succeeding hundred years, and culminated in the
disasters of the Revolutionary period. They permitted the alienation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_325"></a>[325]</span>
of a strip to the west of their grounds, through which the
municipality drove in 1673 the new street which, in compliment
to the Order, they called “Rue de l’Observance,” after the name
of their rule.</p>

<p>With this exception no important change occurred to change
the aspect of the quarter until the Revolutionary period with
which we have to deal.</p>

<p class="tb">We are, after this general description, in a position to recognise
the site of the Cordeliers in modern Paris. As you go down
the Boulevard St. Germains, just before you reach the Boulevard
St. Michel (going east), you see a street leading off at a slight
angle to the right. It is the Rue de l’École de Médecine, the
college after which it is named facing both on this street and on
the Boulevard. This street is merely the Rue des Cordeliers
broadened and modernised. As you go a few yards up this street,
you see on your left the great court of the college, and if you
stand at its gate and look at the opposite side of the street, at
the new buildings which are now the lecture-rooms and theatres
of the Faculty, you are looking at the site of the old church,
which has disappeared during this century. The street has been
broadened by taking down the southern side, so that the church
would actually have overlapped the modern street. Continuing,
you pass on your right the open yard leading up to what was
the hall of the Cordeliers, and is now the museum of surgery
(the Musée Dupuytren), and a few yards farther brings you into
the Boulevard St. Michel. Following this very broad avenue for
twenty yards at the most, you may note a new street, the “Rue
Racine,” turning off to the right. This did not exist in Danton’s
time, but it lies <i>nearly</i> on the line that separated the Cordeliers
from the Collège d’Harcourt (at present the Lycée St. Louis). As
a fact, the line was a trifle to the south of the Rue Racine, and of
course more irregular. The Rue Racine in its turn leads you into
that old street the “Rue de Monsieur le Prince.” If you turn
again to the right and go down this some hundred yards, you are
still following the boundary of the Cordeliers, till you reach the
“Rue Antoine Dubois.” This is identical with the old “Rue
de l’Observance,” spoken of above, and a few steps down this
short street leads you to the starting-point in the “Rue de l’École<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_326"></a>[326]</span>
de Médecine.” Such a modern itinerary would describe as nearly
as is now possible the circumference of the college and estate of
the Cordeliers. The quadrilateral comprised by these four streets,
the Rue de l’École de Médecine, the Rue Racine, the Rue M. de
le Prince, and the Rue Antoine Dubois, is the site of the famous
convent and its grounds.</p>

<p>To reproduce the quarter in 1788 we have to imagine the
following changes:—The Rue de l’École de Médecine, very narrow,
flanked for the greater part of its southern side with the
church and old wall of the convent. It leads into a little narrow
street called the “Rue de la Harpe,” which went right up the
hill, and would correspond to a strip taken in the exact centre of
the present Boulevard St. Michel. The first few buildings here,
notably the Church of St. Come, were still on the Cordeliers’
estate. Just above them, however, began the grounds and buildings
of the “College d’Harcourt.” As we have observed, the Rue
Racine did not exist, nor anything corresponding to it. To follow
the boundaries of the estate you would have had to let yourself in
by a side-door, and then you might have followed a long, irregular
wall which separated their land from the College d’Harcourt.
This wall, after passing through a great garden, came out on the
Rue Monsieur le Prince, and the rest of one’s circuit would be
much what it is to-day.</p>

<p>Finally, to see the building as Danton saw it, you must
imagine a half-deserted place, rich, but somewhat unfrequented,
like certain old legal Inns that once stood in London, old walls
appearing here and there from between houses of a century’s date;
a mass of irregular buildings, of garden and of private house
hopelessly intermingled; while up a narrow and dark passage
stood the Hall, which was still the best preserved part of the
college, and with which alone his name is associated.</p>

<span class="smaller">NOTE ON CERTAIN SITES MENTIONED IN THIS BOOK</span></h3>

</div>

<p>It may be of interest to those who desire to study with some particularity
the personal history of Danton to know where are to be
found in modern Paris the places with which we have found him
personally connected in this book.</p>

<p>His first offices were in the Rue des Mauvaises Paroles. This
street has disappeared in the improvements which included the
prolongation of the Rue de Rivoli. This office in the Rue des
Mauvaises Paroles occupied almost exactly the same spot, which
can be recognised to-day in the following manner. As you go
along the northern side of the Rue de Rivoli going east, you come
to a point 500 yards or so from the Louvre, from whence you begin
to see the Tour St. Jacques just peering round the southern
side of the street. The shops which are then upon your left hand
and the pavement upon which you stand correspond to the position
of the old mansard house in which Danton served his apprenticeship.
It was here that he had his first offices; it was from this
that he bought the business of Monsieur M. de Paisy in the Rue
de la Tissanderie.</p>

<p>Concerning the position of these offices in the Rue de la Tissanderie,
which he moved into, I have been able to learn nothing.
There is a curious little record in the police archives of Paris—Danton
complaining that he could not work on account of the
noise that a saddle-maker made in the exercise of his trade in the
same house. In this little document, which is quoted by Monsieur
Clarétie in his “Life of Camille Desmoulins,” the house is mentioned
as being “just opposite the Rue des Deux Portes”; but as
an inference to be drawn from the same record is that he left
immediately after for some other lodging in the same street, this
does not help us much.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_328"></a>[328]</span></p>

<p>I have said in the text that Danton lived, during the six years
which were those of his active political life, in a house of the
Passage du Commerce. I have also mentioned in the text the
fact that Dr. Robinet mentions a short residence in the Rue
des Fossés Saint Germains. I have given, moreover, in the
same passage my reasons for following M. Aulard in rejecting
this first address. It seems proved that, after he left the Rue de
la Tissanderie, he moved with his wife to the corner house of the
Passage du Commerce. This was his home during the whole of
the Revolution, and it is worth while to describe its position and
character with some care.</p>

<p>In the first place, it has disappeared; the construction of the
Boulevard St. Germains destroyed all that end of the Cour du
Commerce. If you are going along the Boulevard St. Germains
from the west towards the University, you pass on the right the
statue of Danton. It is erected on an open triangle of ground,
formed by the junction of the Boulevard and of the Rue de l’École
de Médecine. The apex of this triangle, not twenty yards from
the statue, marks the site of the old house in which Danton and
Desmoulins lived, and in which they were arrested before their
trial.</p>

<p>The old quarter was a network of narrow streets, and where
the Boulevard St. Germain now stands, an intricate block of
houses, with courtyards and passages, not unlike the similar
intricate masses which you will find in the City of London,
formed the northern side of the Rue des Cordeliers (that is to
say, the modern Rue de l’École de Médecine). A narrow alley,
known as the Cour de Commerce, joined this Rue des Cordeliers
by a still narrower passage. Danton’s house was the corner house,
as is proved by the mention in the inventory that some rooms
looked upon this passage and some upon the Rue des Cordeliers.</p>

<p>Of course he did not occupy the whole of it, but, in the Parisian
custom, which had already obtained for more than a century, he
took a flat, and two rooms (used as a lumber and as a servant’s
bedroom) were added from the entresole below. This flat was
just such an apartment as a similar bourgeois householder would
have in Paris to-day: a dining-room, two bedrooms, a study, a
little library, a drawing-room, a kitchen, and offices, built round
the staircase and courtyard or well of the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_329"></a>[329]</span></p>

<p>I have been unable to find any mention of the rental which
was paid, but a guess at something like £150 a year in that
quarter at that time for such a flat would, I think, not be
extravagant. The corresponding flat above, Desmoulins took
after his romantic marriage in December 1790, but he did not
begin to occupy the house until the early part of 1791. It was
here that his little Horace was born; it was here that his wife
and Danton’s passed the terrible night of the 10th of August, and
it was here, in the great bedroom overlooking the Rue des Cordeliers,
that Danton’s wife died in February 1793.</p>

<p>As to the furniture of the little apartment, it may be described
as follows:—The drawing-room was not very large, but there had
been spent upon it the most considerable sum in the furnishing
of the house. It figures for very nearly a third in the valuation,
which may be read in <a href="#APPENDIX_VII">Appendix VII.</a> The white furniture, which
was the mark of the eighteenth century, was its principal note; it
is also worth observing that the household was sufficiently cramped
for room to use the cupboards in the drawing-room as wardrobes.
The principal bedroom was well furnished, but, as you will find
to be the case in such houses in Paris, the study, the dining-room,
and the spare room to the side of the study were very bare. It
is also remarkable that the lumber-room held nothing but two
trunks and an old double bedstead. It was the household of a
man who made every effort to maintain his position before his
wife’s friends, but who was not wealthy, and who had evidently
arranged the scale of his expenditure considerably below the
probable receipts which an office such as his would have brought
in. I should much doubt whether as much as £500 a year would
go out on such an establishment, though he was certainly receiving
£1000. We know the reason of this; he had to pay off by every
means in his power the debt which he had incurred in buying the
practice. While he lived in this house, and until the office was
suppressed in 1790, he continued to keep his business rooms in
the Rue de la Tissanderie. It may be worthy of mention that
he kept two servants, and that his apartment was on the first,
whilst that of Desmoulins was on the second floor of the house.</p>

<p>As to the Cordeliers, on which the preceding note is written,
the hall in which their meetings were first held still exists (as
we have said in the text) under the title of Musée Dupuytren.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_330"></a>[330]</span>
The Church of the Cordeliers, into which they afterwards moved, has
disappeared, but the last locale of the club (when the Municipality
had turned them out of the church in 1791) still remains, and is
to be discovered at No. 105 Rue Thionville. Danton’s father-in-law
had been master of a café on the Quai de l’École. This house
still remains. If I am not mistaken, it was altered slightly during
the restorations of the Second Empire. It is the house which now
stands at the south-western corner of the Place de l’École, and
which faces the quai on one side and the square on the other.
The street and quay outside M. Charpentier’s café was, however,
somewhat oblique to the modern street, and ran less east than
west, more south-east than north-west, than it does to-day.</p>

<p>The quay has been raised and the old fountain in the Place
de l’École destroyed. Otherwise the quarter is much the same.
The café became famous later for its draught players, a reputation
that still continues.</p>

<span class="smaller">NOTE ON THE SUPPOSED VENALITY OF DANTON</span></h3>

</div>

<p>I will not go in this note into any of the general considerations
which have led the greater part of modern historians to reject the
legend of Danton’s venality. These general considerations are by
far the strongest arguments upon which we can rely in this matter,
but I trust that the character which I have attempted to draw in
the text of the book will furnish them in sufficiency.</p>

<p>Neither do I desire to insist in this note upon the unquestionable
value of the two principal modern authorities in England and
in France (Mr. Morse Stephens and M. Aulard), who both of
them regard the question as finally settled in Danton’s favour. I
have insisted sufficiently upon this in the text. What I shall
attempt to do is to quote the contemporary accusations, to determine
how much reliance can be placed upon them, to show their
character, and to describe in what way and to what extent they
are explained by documents which have since come to light.</p>

<p class="tb">First of all, a list of those contemporaries who took his venality
for certain. It is very formidable.</p>

<p>Mirabeau (letter to Lamarck, Thursday, 10th March 1791).—...
“Montmorin has told me ... of particular schemes ...
for instance, that Beaumetz and ... D’Andrée dined yesterday
alone and got Danton’s confidence ... and then proposed to
demolish Vincennes in order to make themselves popular. Danton
got 30,000 livres yesterday, and I have the proof that Danton
inspired the last number of Desmoulins’ paper.... If it is
possible I intend to risk 6000 livres, but at any rate they will
be more innocently distributed than the 30,000 livres of Danton.”
Here is a categorical statement in which a man says what the
court had often said (and Mirabeau was then an agent of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_332"></a>[332]</span>
court), “I have managed Danton at such and such a price,” and
the passage gives us indirectly the name of Montmorin. The date
should be noted.</p>

<p>Bertrand de Molleville, a far less practical and a far less
careful man than Mirabeau, also a singularly untrustworthy
authority, has the following:—Memoirs Particuliers, i. 354.—“By
the hands of this man Durand, under the ministry of De Montmorin,
Danton received more than 50,000 francs to propose certain
motions of the Jacobins. He was fairly faithful in keeping this
contract, but stipulated that he should be left free as to the means
he employed.” ... Again ... “In the first debates upon the
king’s trial the infamous Danton, whose services had been so dearly
paid <i>out of the Civil List</i>, was one of those who displayed the
greatest violence. I was the more alarmed as this scoundrel was
at the moment (Autumn 1792) a most powerful and dangerous man
in the Assembly. The ardent zeal which I felt for the safety of the
king, and which would have made me think all means legitimate,
suggested this means against Danton to neutralise the rage of the
monster; and though the method I took required a lie, I did not
hesitate to employ it without the least scruple. I wrote to him
on the 11th December:—‘I must not leave you ignorant, Sir, of
the fact that I have found in the papers of the late Monsieur
Montmorin notes of the dates of the sums which have been paid
out of the secret service money, including a receipt in your handwriting.
Hitherto I have made no use of this document, but I
warn you that I have enclosed them in a letter which I am writing
to the President of the Convention, and I will have them printed
and placarded on the corners of the streets if you do not conduct
yourself well in the trial of the king.’ As a fact, Montmorin had
shown me these papers a year before, though he had not given
them to me. But Danton knew they existed, and knew how
intimate had been my relations with Montmorin. He did not
reply to the letter, but I saw in the published prints that he had
got himself named deputy in a mission to the army of the North.
He only returned at the end of the king’s trial, and contented
himself with voting for death without giving any opinion.”
(Particular Memoirs, ii. 288-291.) I would have the reader to
specially mark this extract, to which I shall return at the end of
my note, as it can be easily proved by internal evidence to be a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_333"></a>[333]</span>
falsehood. It is, indeed, of more value to any one who desires to
write a life of Bertrand himself, than it is to one who is writing
the life of Danton.</p>

<p>Thirdly, Lafayette says (Memoirs, iii. 83-85): “Danton, whose
receipt for 100,000 francs was in the hands of Montmorin,
asked for Lafayette’s head; that was running a great risk, but he
depended on the discretion of Lafayette and on his keeping a
secret. For Lafayette to have spoken would have been to have
signed the death-warrant of Montmorin, who had paid Danton in
order to moderate his anarchic fury.” And again (iv. 328-330),
he says of Danton: “He was a vulgar tribune and incapable of
turning the masses from evil by persuasion or by respect, but he
knew how to flatter their passions, &amp;c. &amp;c.... I knew him
from the first week of the Revolution in the district of Cordeliers,
whither I had been attracted. After the 6th October he took
money from Montmorin, whom he caused in consequence to be
assassinated on the 2nd September. In connection with this
secret he said to me once, ‘General, I know you do not know me,
I am more of a Monarchist than you.’... I have learnt since
from the person to whom Madame Elizabeth told it that he had
received, about the 10th August, a considerable sum to give the
movement a direction in the king’s favour, and, indeed, he got the
royal family sent to the Temple. He said to a friend of the king,
‘It is I who will save him or kill him.’”</p>

<p>Fourthly, there is Brissot (iv. 193-194). “Among the stipendiaries
of Orleans was ... Danton. I have seen the receipt for
500,000 francs which were paid him by Montmorin. He was
sold to the court in order to thrust the Revolution into the
excesses which would make it odious to the great bulk of Frenchmen.”</p>

<p>Fifthly, Madame Roland (who has so much to say against a
character so profoundly antipathetic to her) has this special
passage on his corruption (Dauban’s edition, 1864, pp. 254-255):
“He went to Belgium to augment his wealth, and dared to
admit a fortune of 1,400,000 francs, to assume luxury,” &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>

<p>Sixthly (if it is worth quoting), among the papers that
Robespierre left, in the notes that formed the basis of St. Just’s
report, are the words—“Danton owed an obligation to Mirabeau;
it was Mirabeau who got him repaid the price of his practice. It<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_334"></a>[334]</span>
has even been said that he was paid twice. I heard him admit
to Fabre certain thefts of shoes belonging to the army.”</p>

<p>Such are the contemporary accusations. There are the following
points to be noted with regard to them. No one says that he
himself paid money; the sums of money are very various. They
are paid, according to some, on a few definite occasions; according
to others, upon all occasions. Finally, every accusation that has
any definite basis at all pivots round the name of Montmorin.
“Montmorin held the receipt,” “Montmorin told me,” and so
forth. Now, if we remember that Montmorin held the receipt for
a legitimate and open reimbursement (see <a href="#APPENDIX_VI">Appendix VI.</a>), and then
compare the accusations with what we know of the men and of
the time, if we then proceed to check these merely general conclusions
by matters of absolute knowledge drawn from the valuations
upon Danton’s estate at various moments of his life, we shall agree
with the more modern authorities who have worked with the
documents before them, that Danton is innocent of actions to
the charge of which his uncertain temper and his lack of solid
social surroundings laid him open.</p>

<p>In the first place, let us consider the words of the accusations
which appear above, and which include all those of any importance.</p>

<p>That of Mirabeau is what you would expect from such a man;
it is quiet, contemptuous, treating of Danton as something on the
very last level of the time. But if we take the specific accusation
and separate it from all general points of view, we find this much:
that Montmorin has been talking to him with regard to what
“those fellows” were doing. “In connection with this,” says
Mirabeau, “Danton got 30,000 yesterday” to work such and such
a political move. The grave feature in the quotation is the way
in which Mirabeau, who understood men and who had a good
grasp of Paris, treats Danton’s venality as being something well
known, gives a particular example of it, and passes at once to
other things. But the specific accusation is hearsay from Montmorin,
and, as I have said, it is always Montmorin’s name which
crops up when this gossip is on foot.</p>

<p>I would, therefore, sum up the value of Mirabeau’s accusation
somewhat as follows:—If we could prove that Danton was a
spendthrift, and that large sums of money passed through his
hands for his personal pleasures, then Mirabeau’s chance remark,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_335"></a>[335]</span>
while it would be worthless in a court of law, ought to have some
small weight before history. Mirabeau was (on a higher plane) a
<i>bon viveur</i> such as Danton was reputed to be, and the circles in
which the men moved touched each other especially in the point
of their good living; but if we can find that Danton did not, as a
fact, spend nor invest great sums of money, then the accusation
is simply a common error based upon a remark of Montmorin’s,
suited to the current impression of Danton’s character, but disproved
by the known facts of Danton’s life.</p>

<p>Bertrand de Molleville’s accusation is of particular value to
any one who is concerned, as I am, in attempting to get to the truth
in this matter. It is the only one which is perfectly categorical
and detailed. In proportion as it is categorical and detailed it is
untrue. If you wish to know whether a man has committed a
certain crime, and you hear a number of witnesses against him, one
of whom only gives careful evidence with dates, details, and so
forth, and if you can then prove that this witness has lied upon
all the points which supported his principal accusation, you are
in a fair way to winning your case.</p>

<p>De Molleville begins by making the sum 500,000 francs. It
seems enormous. It is a sum which no man could receive and
spend in a few days’ debauch without attracting the attention of
the whole city, which no man could invest without leaving some
obvious accession of property, and he puts the receipt of this sum
as coming under Montmorin’s ministry—that is, at a time when
public order was secured, when the course of the registries, the
transmission of property and so forth, were in the fullest light.</p>

<p>He gives the name of the man who handed him the sum, and
calls him Durand. On this point it is impossible to say yes or no,
but we can say with absolute certitude that the incident of the
letter upon which Bertrand de Molleville makes the whole matter
turn, is an untruth added to an untruth. In the first place, he
makes Danton “violent in his demands against the king.” This
accusation is absolutely false.</p>

<p>When the trial of the king was mooted, Danton did speak
(notably on the 6th of September), with some decision in favour
of the king’s being brought to trial upon particular points. He
expressed himself in that speech with very great energy upon
this particular feature of the trial, that the king merited condemnation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_336"></a>[336]</span>
because he had obviously and openly betrayed the
nation,—a thing which nobody doubted, which nobody denied,
and which Louis himself and his advisers would simply have
met by saying (at a later epoch of course), “We called in the
foreigner as a necessary police in the time of anarchy; we
desired to save France by its betrayal.” So far, however, from
Danton being a leader of the attack on Louis or of the demand
for his trial, that attack and that demand were as spontaneous as
anything the Convention ever did; and Danton followed rather
than led, as a glance at the <i>Moniteur</i> can prove.</p>

<p>In the much more important debates wherein the life of Louis
was first implicitly and then explicitly at stake, Danton was
absent, and in the days of November there is no question at all
but that Danton’s one preoccupation was to reconcile the Mountain
with the Girondins.</p>

<p>De Molleville goes on to give his letter a date—such things
are done on purpose, as a rule, in order to give a special character
of legal evidence to one’s accusations. He says that he wrote the
letter on the 11th of December, that Danton on receiving the
letter was frightened, and without replying to it got himself put
upon the mission to the army of the North.</p>

<p>Now Danton left for the army of the North on the 1st of
December, and if the letter was written at all (which I doubt),
it was written at a time when Danton, being absent, could not
possibly have acted as De Molleville said he did. He could not
have “asked” to go on a mission (he did not ask, but was sent),
and have started on the 1st in consequence of a letter written on
the 11th.</p>

<p>Finally, De Molleville says he came back to vote on the
punishment of the king, but had been coerced by the letter into
merely voting for death without giving his opinion. This again
is a lie. If there is anything remarkable to the historian in the
vote Danton gave on the 16th January 1793, and in the speech
which he made before his vote, it is that he, by nature so wary,
should have discovered in this crisis a violent manifestation of
opinion and motive. I have amply shown in the text that we
could only reconcile those abnormal days in Danton’s life by some
extreme shock to the emotions. Some represent him as suffering
a violent rebuff from his political opponents; some consider the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_337"></a>[337]</span>
scene of misery and impending death which he found in his home
on returning from his long journey. He demanded a simple
majority vote; he spoke violently against the appeal to the people;
and when he voted for the death of the king he turned to the
Right and said, “I am not a statesman; I am not one of those
who are ignorant of the duty of not compromising with tyrants,
and who do not know that kings can only be struck on the head,
who do not know that we can expect nothing from the kings of
Europe save by force and by arms. I vote for the death of the
tyrant.”</p>

<p>If these are the words, and if that is the action of a man
terrorised by a letter into a silent and furtive vote, then evidence
has no meaning.</p>

<p>De Molleville, I think, can in this, as in nearly all his historical
evidence (with the exception of that which turns upon the
personal habits of the king, where he has the details of a valet),
be dismissed.</p>

<p>With Lafayette, again, we have that half-truth and half-lie
which runs through all his accusations. “The receipt for 100,000
francs was in the hands of Montmorin.” This was true. The
sum was not quite 100,000, it was 61,000 (Appendix VI.); but
the receipt did exist, and to any one who did not know that all
the men occupying positions on the Council had been reimbursed,
it might look like a receipt for a bribe, or might be twisted into
meaning such. It is impossible for us to discover whether Lafayette
meant to tell an untruth, as we can prove De Molleville
did; he may in this matter have been perfectly loyal, for there
was a note found among his papers after his death (Memoirs, iii.
84-85), saying that “a position on the Councils was only worth
10,000, and had been reimbursed at 100,000 as a bribe.” We
now know from the discovery of so many receipts that from
60,000 to 80,000 was the regular price of reimbursements, but
Lafayette might easily have been ignorant of this, and have
jumped to a false conclusion.</p>

<p>As to his mention of Madame Elizabeth’s having told the man
who told him that Danton had been paid before the 10th August,
the old man’s memory is certainly turning to the remark which
many witnesses heard from the lips of that saintly woman just
before the attack on the Tuilleries, when she said with simplicity<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_338"></a>[338]</span>
(she knew nothing at all of the characters of the Revolution save
what she might hear from the courtiers), “Well, we can count on
Danton; he has been paid.” That is not evidence. If Danton
was paid to make the 10th of August turn in favour of the
monarchy, and if, as Lafayette hints, he had attempted to make it
so turn, he certainly took the most extraordinary way of defending
his employers. One might as well say that Lord Chatham’s
principal object in the taking of Quebec was the defence of the
French power in Canada. For the 10th of August was openly
and directly an attack upon the ancient crown of France, to overthrow
it and to substitute in its place a new regime, and Danton
worked at it as indefatigably as a general before a battle would
work.</p>

<p>The remark, “General, I am more monarchist than you,” reads
to me like truth; it is exactly what Danton would have said.
He despised Lafayette as much as any one man can despise
another. He believed right up to the moment of the war that
the existing fact of the monarchy was worth all the theories in
the world as a nucleus for the new regime, and he saw the
emptiness of Lafayette’s vanity. He may quite probably have
met it upon some occasion as direct as that which Lafayette has
given us, and Lafayette, in the abundance of his folly, may quite
easily have misunderstood the meaning of his criticism.</p>

<p>Brissot is an admirable example of how the false rumours
arose. He says: “I have myself seen the receipts which Montmorin
held from Danton.”</p>

<p>Now, as we have seen, that receipt (to any one who did not
know the details of the transaction) might quite honestly appear
a damning piece of evidence, and it is without question the
document round which the great mass of accusations have been
built.</p>

<p>As to Madame Roland, I cannot imagine what flight of feminine
inaccuracy made her put down a fortune of £60,000 to her enemy’s
name. If a witness in any other circumstances than revolution
should tell one that a young lawyer and politician had secretly and
suddenly become possessed of this sum, he would be reputed mad.
In such a time, however, anything seems possible to an enemy,
and we must rely upon the simple fact that Danton can be definitely
proved neither to have spent, invested, nor left a tenth of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_339"></a>[339]</span>
such a sum. It seems to me that this accusation of Madame
Roland’s is on a par with that other extreme remark that she had
known “the Dantons living on 16s. a week, which they borrowed
regularly from their father-in-law,” and this “at the opening of the
Revolution,” a time when we know him positively to have been
defending cases involving half a million pounds in the issue of the
trial, and when we know him to have had for clients some of the
richest men in France.</p>

<p>Now, the papers that prove Danton’s financial position are
quite simple. He was cut off suddenly; they were all seized, and
they all remain. Unless he spent huge sums in debauch (sums
like those of Orleans), or unless he buried the money, he cannot
have received much more than what openly appears. He entered
his married life with a debt of £2500 secured on his office. He
enjoyed a good practice for four years; he was reimbursed to somewhat
less than the value of his office, and on his death the sum
sequestrated by the State, and later refunded to his sons, tallies with
this small fortune.</p>

<h3 class="nobreak" id="APPENDIX_IV">IV<br />
<span class="smaller">NOTE ON DANTON’S RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE MASSACRES OF SEPTEMBER</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The arguments for and against Danton’s responsibility in this
matter must necessarily be of a more general order than those
which can be advanced for and against his character in regard to
money matters. There are but one or two really definite facts
upon either side, and, as the purport of these notes is to deal
with actualities, I will treat of these known facts only.</p>

<p>In the first place, it must be clearly understood that Danton
did not shrink from, and was not unsympathetic with, the extreme
measures of the Revolution. His position with regard to them is
perfectly clear in history, and is simply this—his violence was
persuaded that an exceptional time required, almost as a method
of government, the most exceptional terrors.</p>

<p>But, on the other hand, Danton was a man to whom not only
a useless massacre but a useless anything was detestable. Death
in itself, the infliction of death on others, even the death to
which he himself was led, never seemed to him a matter of vast
moment. It is a common fault in courageous men to have this
disregard for the life of others and of oneself, but I deny that
you will ever discover Danton causing the death of a single
human being unless it is in the furtherance of his policy.</p>

<p>In the second place, consider what is actually known to have
proceeded from his mouth. (1) Quite early in the Revolution (in
June 1791) he demanded the head of Lafayette, and he probably
meant it; (2) he boasted of, or confessed to, being the
author of Mandat’s death; (3) in the course of speeches which
led up to the establishment of the Revolutionary tribunal he
speaks in favour of the extreme penalties and of the terror that
they would inspire, always as a means to an end, and as a means
to be employed without hesitation. Let me quote but one sentence<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_341"></a>[341]</span>
from the speech of the 10th March 1793 to illustrate what
I mean:—“I feel to what a degree it is necessary to take judicial
measures by which we may punish the counter-revolutionaries.
This tribunal should be erected in order to replace for them the
supreme tribunal of popular vengeance. It is very difficult to
define a political crime, but if a man of the common people for
his sort of misdeed gets punished at once, is it not necessary that
extreme laws, something out of the common running of our social
machinery, should be passed to terrify rebels and to strike the
guilty? In this matter the safety of the people demands from
you extreme methods and the measures of terror.”</p>

<p>Finally, we know that Danton was, on the whole, the guide of
that earlier part of the Terror between May and August 1793, in
which (as he thought) the system was doing necessary work
without which the nation could not have been saved.</p>

<p>Now, let us set against these what we definitely know of
Danton’s character which would lead us to a conclusion that he
would not have countenanced massacre.</p>

<p>No one questions the fact that the leading motive in Danton’s
mind was the establishment of a strong government around or
in the place of a weak monarchy. He was a true descendant of
the lawyers of the Code. The massacres of September took place
at a moment when he was using the whole of his personal energy
in trying as well as may be to supply that Government. He
guides the ministry in Paris; he dominates Roland as a man
might dominate a woman. It was of supreme importance to such
a scheme that the thin ice between government and anarchy in
the days that preceded Valmy should not be broken. The massacre
of September broke it; there was a week of anarchy in
Paris. There is the first great argument against Danton’s complicity
with the massacres.</p>

<p>It must, however, be remembered that a theory exists, by no
means untenable, which would make Danton argue something in
this fashion: “Once let the popular fury have full rein against
what it regards as the internal enemy, and I shall have the disappearance
of that disturbing factor of royalist reaction in Paris,
while on the part of the mob I shall have the lassitude and shame
that follow excess; they are not difficult to govern.” It is only a
personal opinion, but it seems to me that in a mind of Danton’s<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_342"></a>[342]</span>
type, downright and practical to excess, such a far-reaching and
subtle idea as the last would hardly occur, and that the massacres
must have produced on him an especial annoyance, because they
were the breakdown of a system the support of which occupied
his every effort.</p>

<p>Secondly, Danton’s allusions to the massacres of September
were always of a more definite and more reasonable nature than
those of his colleagues. The attitude which he adopts with
regard to them after their occurrence is this: “There was no
public force, none of that disciplined government which I postulate
as the first necessity of the Revolution; nothing on earth
could prevent them, and they occurred in spite of every governing
power.” So much for generalities.</p>

<p>Now let us turn to one or two points which have been made
the basis of a definite accusation against Danton in this matter.</p>

<p>Firstly: that he knew that the massacres were coming, and
withdrew from prison more than one of his friends on the eve of
the uprising. This I take to be true, or rather I am certain of it;
but one would have to be very ignorant of the time not to know
that all Paris expected the massacres, and that those who were at
all in touch with the Commune knew two or three days before
that anything illegal might be done. To have worked to prevent
them, in which Danton might have employed his energy, would,
as I have said in the text, have been to risk that which he
most desired, and to risk it for the sake of saving the prisoners.
Certainly he did not desire to save them as passionately as he
desired to remain at the helm and build up a government; he
preferred to keep his influence over the city. That accusation
is just.</p>

<p>Secondly, it is affirmed with justice that Danton, from the
peculiar position of the ministry which he occupied, filled the
prisons, which were afterwards gutted. It is true that on Danton,
as Minister of Justice, and above all as a general power in the
Cabinet, the responsibility of arresting the prisoners rests; but
was this action taken with a knowledge of what the consequences
would be nearly a month later? Certainly not. It would show
a complete ignorance of what happened in the last fortnight of
August to say that an action taken just after the 10th was taken
with a view to something that would occur on the 2nd of September.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_343"></a>[343]</span>
The state of public feeling in those four weeks went
through a most violent crisis, and one might say that the intensity
of the feeling against the Royalists and the foreigners was not
only a hundred-fold greater when Verdun was actually falling
than it had been just after the success against the Tuilleries, but
different in quality as well.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there is one detailed accusation—the circular which
Marat sent out to the Departments. If it can be proved that this
circular was approved of, that its distribution was aided by Danton,
then we shall have a definite piece of evidence which cannot be
overridden. Now let me describe what that circular was, and
see how far we must blame circumstances, how far the carelessness,
and how far the deliberate act of the minister. All the accounts
are much the same. Madame Roland says, “Sent out above the
signature of the Minister of Justice.” Bertrand de Molleville is
also perfectly definite (Memoirs, ix. 310)—“Sent by the minister
Danton.”</p>

<p>The examination of the documents seventy years later has
given more accurate results to history than the memoirs of contemporaries,
whether they are truthful and enthusiastic like
Madame Roland, or frankly dishonest like Bertrand de Molleville.
Bougeart was at the pains of looking up the original
documents at the archives of the police. What appears in this
document (Bougeart, pp. 121-122) is a series of signatures,
Panis, Sergent, Marat, &amp;c., that is, the Committee of Surveillance
appointed by the Commune. There is no trace of any ministerial
signature, and even the stamp which was used in the office by the
clerks for everything that passed officially through the Ministry
of Justice is not attached to the sheet. What did happen was
this. The circulars were sent out in envelopes which bore the
official mark of the Ministry. It is as though some act of a body
in London, let us say, should be distributed to the provinces
in the blue envelopes of Her Majesty’s Service. That is all,
either for or against Danton, that remains of the incident of the
circular.</p>

<p>Now it is certain that Danton had not at that time openly
broken with Marat. Moreover, Danton had not actually quarrelled
with the Commune, though he certainly treated it with
contempt. But Danton had no conceivable object in helping<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_344"></a>[344]</span>
Marat to distribute the circulars unless he himself was openly on
Marat’s side. A man of his character would either have signed,
or else, had he known that the circulars were going out, he would
have forbidden their distribution; he would have taken some
definite line. Why? Because the distribution of the circular
was bound to condemn him to a very definite position—here is a
man who has stood aloof from a very violent conspiracy, a conspiracy
whose authors came out at last in the open day and
gloried in what they had done. They wrote the most violent
of all their manifestoes, containing such phrases as “the
ferocious prisoners have been put to death by the people;” “it
was an act of justice indispensable to our Committee,” and so
forth. It would be quite impossible to send out unwittingly such
a circular as that without knowing that one was compromising
oneself and definitely entering the most extreme party of the
Parisians. It is inconceivable, therefore, that he would have lent
official envelopes for the purpose, and have said, “So far I will
help you, but I will not help you more than that.” You might
as well suppose an English official in India, of the stronger kind,
saying, “I will allow you, an unofficial personage, to send out the
order for an illegal execution from this office, but I will not put
my name to it.”</p>

<p>Again, how comes it that this document alone, of all those
sent from the Minister of Justice at the time, goes out in the
official envelope, but bears in itself no mark whatsoever of the
Ministry of Justice? How was it that the officials in the country
towns, among the mass of papers that they received from the
Ministry in Paris, should receive this single one without any
stamp or signature, and should then discover that it had proceeded
from a body which had nothing on earth to do with the
Ministry of Justice? There are but two replies possible to this
question—either that the envelopes were taken from the Ministry
by one of the clerks (several of whom we know to have been
intimately linked with the Commune), or that Danton timidly
lent envelopes but refused to do anything further. Of these two
replies, the second appears to me absolutely at variance not only
with Danton’s own character but also with the general routine of
a great office. I cannot conceive the Cabinet Minister offering, in
the very gravest conditions, a few blue envelopes, when a whole<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_345"></a>[345]</span>
political party desire from him a definite pronouncement on one
side or the other.</p>

<p>Finally, it may be asked, could these envelopes go out without
his knowledge? To that I answer that such a thing might be
done from any government office to-day. It was, moreover, a
time of revolution; the whole complicated organism had been
shaken and partly transformed; there was confusion in every
department of the building, and even under these conditions
Danton was doing far more work than depended upon his office.
I think, therefore, that it is eminently possible that the circulars
should have been sent out by one of the clerks without his knowledge;
and the fact that no signature was used, and that the
documents did not even pass through one of the many hands
whose duty it was to affix the formal stamp, still further corroborates
the view that the circulation of the appeal was surreptitious.</p>

<p>As to the accusations such as that of Lafayette (Memoirs,
iv. 139, 140), “He commanded the massacre of September and
paid the murderers, who went all covered with blood to get their
money from Roland,” I attach no importance to them at all.
Even the phrase in which Danton is supposed to have saluted the
return of the murderers from Versailles is very doubtful. It does
not occur in any contemporary account; it is not in the <i>Moniteur</i>;
it is not in the “Révolutions de Paris;” Madame Roland
does not quote it, even on hearsay; it is not one of Peltier’s
inventions, and I have some difficulty in tracing it to its origin.</p>

<p>I think, then, that the general position of Danton during the
days of September may be summed up as follows. He did not
regard the lives of the prisoners as being of the first importance;
he did not use what would have been to his certain knowledge a
useless energy in protesting; he did not (as he might conceivably
have done) form a special and vigorous tribunal to replace that
which was on the point of acquitting L. de Montmorin. By all
those, therefore, who would regard public order and a security for
life as being more important than the success of a political idea,
or the integrity and defence of a nation, he can be accused of a
criminal negligence in the matter of the massacres of September.
He certainly cannot be accused of having designed them; he
cannot be accused on any definite proof of having approved them,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_346"></a>[346]</span>
and he cannot be accused of having failed to share in the regret
and misery which that terrible blunder caused. If we may judge
the attitude of his mind by comparing it with that of contemporaries,
rather than by comparing it with our own attitude in a
time of security and order, we may say that the massacres taught
him a more definite lesson than they taught to Roland, for they
caused him to pursue a policy of conciliation and to strengthen
the government; that, on the other hand, he did less to stop
them than Manuel did; and that in a comparison with men whom
we know to have been honest, such as Roland himself, or by a
contrast with men whom we know to have been evil, such as
Hébert, or whom we know to have been frenzied, such as Marat—judged
in the midst of all this, Danton will appear responsible to
history for having been guilty of indifference at a moment when
he might have saved his reputation by protesting, though perhaps
his protest would not have saved a single life.</p>

<p class="tb">The object of the remainder of this Appendix is to provide
for the reader certain documents that illustrate the
statements and the line of argument in the text. Of
these documents but few have been translated, because
only a few appeal to any one but a special student of the
Revolution, or are necessary to the understanding of this
book.</p>

<p>By far the most important of the documents here
printed is the last, Barrère’s report of the 29th of May
1793. Hitherto unpublished, it furnishes (to my mind)
the most complete explanation of the somewhat complicated
manœuvres pursued by the Committee, manœuvres
which permitted the revolution of May 31st and June 2nd.</p>

<p>To each document a short preface has been attached
for the purpose of explaining its origin and of mentioning
the authorities (if any) in which it can be found.</p>

<span class="smaller"><span class="smcap">SHORT MEMOIR by A. R. C. de St. ALBIN</span></span></h3>

</div>

<p>This memoir was published for the first time as an article
in the <i>Critique Française</i> of the 15th of March 1864.
It was so published by the author himself, and, though
appearing seventy years after Danton’s death, is not without
importance. De St. Albin, who is better known by his
first name of Rousselin, had some personal acquaintance
with Danton (though he was but a boy at the time) and he
lived to a great age. He had, moreover, an acquaintance
with the family after the Revolutionary period. These
circumstances make his testimony decisive on all non-controversial
points and valuable on many others.</p>

<p>The criticisms to be made against his account are
obvious. It is too florid; it errs also in giving an amiable
and somewhat mediocre character to the statesman himself
and to all his relatives and surroundings. We have
in it but a poor expression of the energy that was Danton’s
chief character, and which the writer’s own mind cannot
reflect. It was, moreover, written so very long after the
events which it describes that in more than one place an
error of date or number has been committed; especially
in the incident of Barentin at the close of the memoir,
with which M. Aulard finds so much fault, and in the
amount of his wife’s dowry, which was not 40,000 but only
20,000 livres. On the other hand, it is fresh, full of personal
recollections, written by a trustworthy man, and
gives many interesting details on the earlier and less
known part of Danton’s life.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_348"></a>[348]</span></p>

<p>“La famille de Danton n’a point à se prévaloir d’une antique
noblesse. Le nom de Danton est commun dans la contrée
d’Arcis-sur-Aube, il est apparu avec un certain bruit, en 1740,
dans les querelles du jansénisme. Parmi les pièces de théâtre
destinées à populariser ces discussions théologiques, il en est une
intitulée <i>La Banqueroute des marchands de miracles</i>, qui est
signée du P. Danton. On a supposé, non sans raison, qui cet
ecclésiastique était un grand-oncle du conventionnel.</p>

<p>“Georges-Jacques Danton naquit à Arcis-sur-Aube le 26 octobre
1759. Il était fils de Jacques Danton, procureur au bailliage
d’Arcis, qui avait épousé, en 1754, Jeanne-Madeleine Camut.
Le père mourut le 24 février 1762, âgé d’environ quarante ans,
laissant sa femme enceinte et quatre enfants en bas âge, deux
filles et deux garçons, Georges-Jacques Danton resta sous la tutelle
de sa mère, femme douée de toutes les qualités qui commandent
l’estime. C’est par la sensibilité et la douceur du caractère que
la mère de Danton élevait et gouvernait sa jeune famille. Georges,
celui de ses enfants dont l’extérieur indiquait le plus de force et
de volonté, était le plus docile envers elle. Se jeune indépendance
était bien vite soumise quand sa mère parlait à son cœur. La
tendresse obtenait ce que la crainte aurait vainement tenté
d’arracher. Madame veuve Danton eut un heureux auxiliaire
pour le soutien de sa maison dans son père, entrepreneur des
ponts et chaussées de la province de Champagne. Celui-ci donna
les premières leçons à son petit-fils: il voyait avec joie ses mâles
dispositions.</p>

<p>“Il est intéressant de noter quel fut le milieu dans lequel
Danton passa ainsi ses premières années, et nous avons trouvé, dans
un auteur contemporain, le passage suivant qui nous semble curieux:</p>

<p>“‘La ville d’Arcis-sur-Aube est composée d’hommes indépendants;
l’air y est vif, les hommes sont robustes; la rivière de
l’Aube, qui traverse le pays, est navigable en tout temps, le
commerce maritime occupe les natifs; quand les marins ne sont
pas occupés à l’eau, ils font des bas; ils sont laborieux, industrieux.
Arcis n’est comparable à aucune partie de la Champagne; les lois
y sont observées comme si elles n’existaient pas, par le seul sentiment
de l’ordre; les seigneurs de l’ancien régime avaient toujours
rencontré des opposants dans des hommes chez qui l’amour de la
liberté est inné.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_349"></a>[349]</span></p>

<p>“L’enfance de Danton n’eut rien de remarquable; il fut élevé,
suivant l’usage du pays, à peu près comme un enfant de la nature.</p>

<p>“Il avait été nourri par une vache, ce qui est usité en Champagne,
quand les mères ne sont pas assez fortes pour allaiter leurs
enfants. La vache nourrice de Danton fut un jour aperçue par
un taureau échappé, qui se précipita sur elle et donna au pauvre
enfant un coup de corne qui lui arracha la lèvre. C’est à cette
cicatrice que tenait la difformité de sa lèvre supérieure.</p>

<p>“En grandissant, Danton, comme tous les êtres doués d’une
force extraordinaire, éprouvait le besoin de l’exercer. Il voulut
un jour faire preuve de vigueur, prendre sa revanche et lutter
contre un taureau. Il était difficile qu’il sortit vainqueur de la
lutte. Un coup de corne lui écrasa le nez.</p>

<p>“Ces accidents auraient dû le rendre prudent, mais il n’y a
guère de prudence là où il y a grande surabondance de vie. Un
jour le robuste enfant croit pouvoir faire marcher devant lui les
porcs de la ferme qui obstruaient l’entrée de la maison. Il les
attaque à coups de fouet; mais son pied glisse, il tombe, et les
porcs devenus furieux, se ruent sur lui et lui font une terrible
blessure, assez semblable à celle dont Boileau fut victime dans
son enfance, au dire d’Helvétius, qui attribuait à cette blessure la
disette de sentiment qu’il prétendait remarquer dans les ouvrages
du poète. Quel que soit le mérite de cette appréciation, elle ne
serait pas applicable à Danton. Sa virilité avait été compromise,
non perdue, et il conserva toute son énergie et toute sa hardiesse.
Rien ne l’arrêtait: chaque jour il donnait de nouvelles preuves
de témérité. A peine fut-il rétabli de ce malheureux accident,
qu’entraîné par sa passion pour la natation, il faillit se noyer et
fut atteint d’une fièvre maligne, à laquelle vint se joindre une
petite vérole très grave, accompagnée du pourpre. Tout semblait
ainsi se réunir pour le défigurer.</p>

<p>“Pour faire contracter à son enfant quelques habitudes de
discipline, la mère de Danton le remit d’abord à la surveillance
d’une maîtresse d’école; celle-ci n’avait pas le temps ou la volonté
d’user avec lui d’indulgence. Danton trouva quelque différence
dans la comparaison de ce nouveau régime avec les tendresses de
sa mère et de son aïeul: non moins sévère que la demoiselle
Lambercier de J.-J. Rousseau, la maîtresse d’école croyait ne
pouvoir se passer de verges pour diriger les enfants, et Danton<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_350"></a>[350]</span>
lui avait paru avoir les premiers droits à ses corrections. Tous
ses contemporains se souvenaient de l’avoir vu faire trop souvent
l’école buissonnière et employer les heures de classe à barboter
dans l’Aube. Il préférait la liberté de vivre à l’ennui de répéter
les caractères de l’alphabet. Il avait cependant d’heureuses aptitudes
et apprenait rapidement; mais toute habitude réglée était
antipathique à sa nature.</p>

<p>“A huit ans, il fut débarrassé de la rigoureuse maîtresse, et
<i>transvasé</i>, comme il le dit lui-même, dans une institution supérieure.
Le chef de cette institution croyait savoir assez de latin pour en
enseigner les éléments. Quand les premiers principes de la grammaire
ne sont pas montrés avec une habile méthode aux jeunes
intelligences, elle leur offre peu d’attrait.</p>

<p>“Danton en avait peu-être un peu moins pour <i>Lhomond</i> que
pour le jeu de cartes. A peine le devoir terminé, en hâte il courait
avec quelques camarades dans un coin pour faire sa partie. Des
billes ou des gâteaux étaient le bénéfice du gagnant. Souvent
vainqueur, il partageait toujours avec le vaincu. Quand il se
trouvait seul, il lisait ou allait se promener ans les bois ou dans
les champs.</p>

<p>“Pour modifier cette humeur un peu sauvage, les parents de
Danton crurent devoir le mettre dans une maison religieuse.</p>

<p>“Quoiqu’il ne fût point destiné à l’état ecclésiastique, on le
plaça d’abord au petit séminaire de <i>Troyes</i>; mais la monotonie de
cette maison lui devint bientôt pénible. Pendant tout le temps
qu’il y resta, il observa la règle, mais il ne pouvait souffrir que
sa récréation fût subitement interrompue par un coup de cloche.
<i>Cette cloche</i>, disait-il, <i>si je suis encore forcé de l’entendre longtemps,
finira par sonner mon enterrement</i>.</p>

<p>“Un reproche mal fondé et reçu publiquement du supérieur
décida Danton à solliciter sa sortie du séminaire.</p>

<p>“Le fait suivant peut être raconté comme trait de caractère:
La pension, dans cette maison, était modique. Les élèves n’avaient
de vin qu’en le payant séparément à la fin de chaque année. Tous
les dimanches on distribuait des cartes, qui étaient une espèce de
billet au porteur. En présentant cette carte au distributeur, on
recevait une mesure de vin appelée <i>roquille</i>. Danton était généreux,
et un de ses grands plaisirs alors était de régaler ses camarades
en leur passant des cartes de <i>roquilles</i>, surtout à ceux qu’il savait<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_351"></a>[351]</span>
n’avoir pas la bourse bien garnie. Sa générosité alla si loin, que,
lorsqu’on fit le compté général et la proclamation publique de tous
ceux qui avaient bu du vin, il se trouva être celui qui avait fait
une plus grande consommation de <i>roquilles</i>. La veille du départ
pour les vacances, le supérieur du petit séminaire adressa ces
paroles à Danton: <i>Mon ami, vous pouvez vous flatter d’être le plus
grand buveur de la communauté</i>. A ces mots, tous les rires
d’éclater sur lui; il ne répondit pas, mais il se promit bien de ne
plus boire de roquilles au petit séminaire. Malgré une véritable
bonté, Danton était peu endurant, et on l’avait surnommé <i>l’anti-supérieur</i>,
et même <i>le républicain</i>.</p>

<p>“A peine revenu à Arcis-sur-Aube, il déclara à sa mère qu’il
ne rentrerait plus au petit séminaire: “Il y a là, dit-il, des habitudes
qui ne me vont pas, et que je ne pourrai jamais comprendre.”
L’année suivante, on le mit dans une pension laïque. Ses études
n’y perdirent rien, car il eut depuis des succès qu’il n’avait pas
obtenus auparavant. Il fit ainsi sa seconde, et y remporta la
presque totalité des prix....</p>

<p>“Nous arrivons au mois de juin 1775. On apprend que le
sacre de Louis XVI. va s’accomplir à Reims. Danton avait déjà
plus d’une fois entendu les imprécations dont toute la France
couvrait la mémoire de Louis XV. A l’âge de seize ans il en
savait assez pour abhorrer l’emploi des lettres de cachet, qui
étaient si prodiguées sous ce règne scandaleux. Le professeur
avait annoncé qu’il donnerait l’événement du sacre du nouveau
monarque comme texte d’amplification: <i>Pour bien se pénétrer de
son sujet</i>, dit Danton d’un ton décidé, <i>il faut se servir de ses yeux.
Je suis curieux de voir comment se fait un roi</i>.</p>

<p>“Son projet n’est confié qu’à quelques fidèles camarades qui
lui prêtent de l’argent pour sa route. Il part sans prévenir son
maître; il traverse son pays d’Arcis sans voir ses parents, dans
la crainte de les trouver opposés à son pèlerinage. Après avoir
franchi vingt-huit lieues sans encombre, il arrive à Reims, se
glisse partout; il suit attentivement toutes les cérémonies du sacre,
et il entend le jeune monarque, la main sur l’Évangile, prononcer
le serment <i>de régner par les lois et pour le bonheur de la nation</i>.
Que des réflexions fait naître un pareil spectacle dans un cerveau
ardent, déjà prompt à concevoir de rapprochements!</p>

<p>“A son retour de Reims, les amis de Danton étaient impatients<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_352"></a>[352]</span>
de l’entendre raconter tout ce qu’il avait vu. Cet appareil ne
l’avait pas émerveillé, la richesse des décors de la cathédrale ne
l’avait pas séduit. Il raisonnait assez déjà pour sentir que ce
n’était guère plus qu’une pompe vaine, encore dispendieuse pour
la France déjà si obérée. Le jeune voyageur s’égayait en parlant
de ce nombreux essaim d’oiseaux de toute espèce auxquels on avait
donné la volée dans l’église: “<i>Plaisante liberté</i>, disait-il, <i>que de
voltiger entre quatre murs, sans avoir de quoi manger ni poser son
nid</i>!” Il comparait aussi les oiseaux babillards aux courtisans
qui entouraient déjà le nouveau roi, par continuation de leur
dévouement pour le défunt. A l’entendre débiter avec autant
de simplicité que de malice ses réflexions sur le luxe, on peut
entrevoir que l’écolier moraliste, devenu grand, ne sera pas sans
quelque exigence envers la royauté, et sans quelque sévérité envers
les agents qui vivent des abus.</p>

<p>“Danton, revenu à Troyes, éprouva des difficultés pour rentrer
à sa pension. Sa sortie, à l’insu du maître, avait indisposé celui-ci.
Le voyageur, soumis et repentant, proteste <i>qu’il na été à
Reims que pour se mettre en mesure de faire en connaissance de
cause son devoir d’amplification sur le sacre</i>. Il produit effectivement
un morceau des plus brillants, mais où il se défend d’introduire
les observations hardies échappées dans la familiarité de
conversation, qui ne peuvent se présenter dans une narration
écrite, dont les convenances sont la première règle. Le maître,
satisfait et surpris du mérite de l’œuvre, en fait lecture à ses
élèves. Il dit <i>qu’il aurait donné la première place à l’auteur s’il
n’avait fait l’école buissonnière</i>. Les camarades de Danton s’unissent
avec enthousiasme à l’appréciation du maître; ils admirent
comment l’enfant prodigue, leur ayant fait un récit aussi piquant,
aussi jovial de son voyage, avait pu en même temps mettre dans
son style autant de réserve et de noblesse. C’est ainsi que Danton
fait admettre ses excuses, et sa grâce est devenue une espèce de
triomphe. Il reprend sa classe, dont les travaux allaient bientôt
se terminer. L’époque des compositions pour les prix annuels
approchait; se fiant à sa facilité, Danton ne semble pas se préparer
au concours. Mais dès que les sujets de composition sont
donnés, il rassemble tous les efforts de son intelligence et obtient
toutes les couronnes. Il déploie d’admirables moyens dans le
discours français, la narration latine et la poésie. Imagination,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_353"></a>[353]</span>
jugement, exactitude, saillie dans la pensée, force, élégance,
originalité dans l’expression, rien ne lui manque, et le 18 août
1775 fut peut-être le plus beau jour de sa vie. Le nom de
<i>Danton-Camut</i> (qui était celui de sa mère pour le distinguer d’un
homonyme son condisciple) fut répété au bruit des fanfares. Si
le lauréat fut heureux, ce fut surtout en apportant ses lauriers à
sa mère, objet de son culte et de son amour; cette piété filiale,
dès lors le plus vif de ses sentiments, demeurera la même dans
son cœur pendant tout le cours de sa vie, quelles qu’en soient
les violences ou les distractions; plus tard, il la montra mieux
encore, et l’homme auquel il voua la haine la plus tenace fut
un misérable soupçonné d’avoir manqué de respect à Madame
Danton.</p>

<p>“Lorsqu’un écolier se distinguait au collège, on songeait à la
carrière que lui ouvriraient ses talents. <i>Il faut en faire un prêtre
ou un procureur.</i> Le curé de Barberey, près Troyes, désignait
déjà Danton pour qu’il lui succédât dans son presbytère; mais le
moment de séjour que Danton avait fait au séminaire ne lui avait
pas inspiré la vocation ecclésiastique. Il avait besoin de liberté,
il lui fallait les franches allures, l’indépendance. Il demandait
une profession libérale, il désirait être avocat.... Démosthènes
et Cicéron, qu’il venait de commencer à connaître n’étaient-ils pas
des avocats? La famille réunie ayant déféré au vœu de Danton,
il fut décidé qu’il irait à Paris et qu’il travaillerait chez un procureur
pour y apprendre la procédure en même temps qu’il ferait
ses études de droit, pour se préparer au barreau.</p>

<p>“Ici vient se placer une circonstance intéressante qui fait
honneur à Danton et qui fournit une nouvelle preuve de sa
tendresse pour ses parents. Madame veuve Danton, demeurée
seule avec sa nombreuse famille, s’était remariée pour lui donner
un soutien. Elle avait épousé M. Recordin, estimable négociant,
dont la bonté est restée proverbiale dans le pays: <i>bon et brave
comme Recordin</i>. Par suite de sa facilité dans ses relations, les
affaires de la maison Recordin se trouvèrent embarrassées. Danton,
loin d’exiger les comptes qu’il avait droit de demander de la
fortune qui lui revenait de son père, fut le premier à offrir des
secours à son beau-père; il mit à sa disposition tout ce qui lui
appartenait; il alla jusqu’à engager la portion du bien de ses
tantes qui devait lui échoir un jour, ne craignant pas d’aliéner<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_354"></a>[354]</span>
son présent en son avenir. <i>Il faut mettre ses affaires en règle,</i>
disait-il, <i>quand on fait un grand voyage</i>.</p>

<p>“Tels furent les préparatifs du départ.</p>

<p>“Tous les témoignages de ses camarades, parents et amis,
déposent de la délicatesse de Danton sous tous les rapports; à
l’exception du prêt de quelques écus qui lui furent offerts par
ses camarades pour le voyage de Reims, il n’a jamais demandé
d’argent à qui que ce soit, dans les moments où, soit comme
écolier, soit comme clerc de procureur, il a pu éprouver de ces
gênes de jeune homme qui rendent hardi aux emprunts.</p>

<p>“Danton arrive à Paris en 1780 dans la voiture du messager
d’Arcis-sur-Aube, qui était l’ami de sa famille, et qui voulut lui
faire la conduite gratuitement. Il se logea à l’auberge du <i>Cheval
noir</i>, tenue rue Geoffroy-Lasnier par un nommé Layron, qui était
l’hôte le plus fréquenté par les Champenois. Danton avait très
peu de fonds, et il dut se mettre immédiatement au travail: il
entra chez un procureur appelé Vinot. Ce procureur commença par
lui demander un modèle de son écriture, qu’il ne trouva pas belle.
Les procureurs de ce temps-là voulaient de ces écritures promptes
et faciles, propres à produire de larges grosses, de longues requêtes.
Le jeune Champenois déclara franchement <i>qu’il n’était pas venu
pour être copiste</i>. Ce ton d’assurance imposa au procureur Vinot.
Il dit: <i>J’aime l’aplomb, il en faut dans notre état</i>.</p>

<p>“Danton fut admis comme clerc, avec la nourriture et le logement.
Il étudia la procédure non sans quelque dégoût; il fut
chargé, comme on dit dans le métier, <i>de faire le palais</i>. C’est
la première initiation des jeunes clercs aux affaires. Elle commence
à les mettre en relation avec les choses et les personnes du
monde judiciaire, et leur donne les éléments de la pratique par de
petits plaidoyers sommaires et des explications contradictoires qui
leur ouvrent les idées et leur apprennent à se conduire dans le labyrinthe
où ils sont destinés à vivre.</p>

<p>“Danton remplissait sa fonction de clerc avec intelligence et
exactitude; ses récréations les plus habituelles étaient toujours
l’escrime, la paume et la natation, sa passion favorite! dont il
usait fréquemment; c’était le besoin même de son tempérament.
Il était assez habile à cet exercice pour être cité au premier rang;
il y trouva un encouragement digne de son émulation. Il sauva
plusieurs fois de la mort des camarades qui auraient péri s’il n’était<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_355"></a>[355]</span>
venu au secours de leur imprudence et de leur faiblesse. Quelques-uns
d’entre eux ont raconté les tours de force véritables que
Danton exécutait dans les courants les plus difficiles de la rivière.
De l’endroit même où ils prenaient leurs ébats, on voyait les tours
de la Bastille, et plus d’une fois les baigneurs ont entendu Danton,
dressant sa tête comme un triton, jeter une menace du côté de la
prison d’État et s’écrier de sa voix vibrante: <i>Ce chateau fort
suspendu sur notre tête m’offusque et me gêne. Quand le verrons-nous
abattu? Pour moi, ca jour là, j’y donnerais un fier coup de
pioche!</i></p>

<p>“Les constitutions les plus robustes sont souvent les plus
exposées, parce que cette exubérance de force donne plus de
sécurité. Danton, à la suite d’une double partie de natation et
d’escrime, fut encore atteint d’une grave maladie. Longtemps
retenu au lit, alors que son corps était réduit à l’inaction, il ne
pouvait se livrer à ses exercices habituels, mais son imagination
ne restait point inactive. Avec son infatigable ardeur de lecture,
il s’obstina à lire <i>l’Encyclopédie</i> tout entière, et il avait achevé ce
labeur si considérable avant que la convalescence fût terminée.
Il trouvait encore le temps de lire les grands publicistes dont les
principes et la morale politique commençaient à devenir les guides
du siècle. Montesquieu qu’il devait souvent citer, fut de sa part
l’objet d’une étude tout particulière, et, après avoir lu <i>l’Esprit des
lois</i>, il disait: <i>Quel horizon nouveau s’ouvre devant moi! Je n’ai
qu’un regret, c’est de retrouver dans l’écrivain qui vous porte si loin
et si haut, le président d’un parlement.</i> De Montesquieu, Danton
passa bientôt à Voltaire, à J.-J. Rousseau, puis à Beccaria, qui
apparaissait alors. Danton ne tarda pas à savoir par cœur l’admirable
petit ouvrage de cet auteur, le traité <i>Des délits et des peines</i>,
qui allait réformer la législation criminelle du monde; afin de se
préparer des couleurs de style pour le jour où il aurait à parler
aux foules, afin d’apprendre, à revêtir les questions sociales des
belles images de la nature, Danton étudia particulièrement l’<i>Histoire
naturelle</i> de Buffon: au moyen de sa puissante mémoire il
en retenait et récitait des pages entières. Voilà d’amples provisions
d’instruction qui pourront trouver un jour un utile emploi
dans la carrière de l’homme public! Tout en dédaignant la littérature
frivole et n’ayant jamais lu de romans que les chefs-d’œuvre
consacrés qui sont des peintures de mœurs, Danton apprit en<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_356"></a>[356]</span>
même temps la langue italienne assez pour lire le Tasse, l’Arioste
et même le Dante. Il faisait aussi des vers avec facilité, quelques-uns
même adressés, en tout bien et tout honneur, à une personne
qui n’était pas indigne de les lui inspirer, à la femme de son
procureur.</p>

<p>“Mais tous ces délassements littéraires étaient en dehors de la
profession qu’il voulait exercer. Ils ne lui firent point négliger
l’apprentissage de la procedure et du droit.</p>

<p>“Il lui restait maintenant à devenir de licencié avocat, et
comme il avait gardé un bon souvenir de la ville de Reims, il alla
se faire recevoir avocat dans cette ville. Champenois de cœur, il
était heureux de contribuer de tous ses moyens à l’honneur de son
pays natal. Il avait toujours de bonnes saillies à son service, et
ne manquait pas une occasion de citer des hommes distingués
dans les lettres et les arts de diverses époques qui appartenaient
à la province de Champagne. Parmi les contemporains, Danton
pouvait du reste trouver plus d’un exemple à l’appui de son
patriotique enthousiasme: c’est ainsi qu’il parlait souvent de
quelques notabilités qu’il connaissait, tels que le savant <i>Grosley</i>,
l’avocat <i>Linguet</i>.</p>

<p>“De retour de Reims à Paris, Danton, après avoir achevé son
stage, s’essaya au barreau de la capitale pendant quelque temps.
Chargé d’une affaire, entre autres, pour un berger contre le
seigneur de son village, il eut l’occasion de produire, en cette
circonstance, quelques-uns des sentiments qu’il devait plus tard
développer davantage sur un grand théâtre. Il réclama avec
autant de vigueur que d’adresse les principes de l’égalité devant
la loi. Il gagna sa cause devant la cour de parlement qui, comme
on se le rappelle, n’était alors composée que de nobles et de privilégiés.
Nous ne sommes encore qu’en 1785. Le factum de Danton
fut imprimé: il était concis, substantiel, énergique—nous n’avons
pu en retrouver la trace.—Cette première lutte soutenue par
Danton fit sensation au palais et valut au jeune avocat des
témoignages d’estime de Gerbier, Debonnière, Hardouin et
toutes les sommités du barreau de cette époque. Linguet, qui se
connaissait en style, et qui, nous l’avons vu, était de Reims, lui
adressa à ce sujet de vifs encouragements.</p>

<p>“Mais les témoignages de ces hommes éminents, qui assuraient
à Danton un succès d’honneur, ne le menaient point à la fortune;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_357"></a>[357]</span>
il s’en éloignait même à mesure que son talent aurait dû l’en
rapprocher davantage, car il recherchait la clientèle du pauvre
autant que d’autres recherchaient la clientèle du riche. Il pensait
qu’en thèse générale le pauvre est le plus souvent l’opprimé,
qu’ainsi il a le droit de priorité à la défense. D’après ce principe
de conduite, ceux qui ont dit que Danton n’avait point fait fortune
au barreau, pouvaient ajouter qu’il ne l’y aurait jamais faite....</p>

<p>“S’ennuyant peut-être un peu, comme on a pu l’entrevoir, dans
sa profession d’avocat, Danton ne demandait point de distraction
à des plaisirs qui auraient pu prendre sur les ressources nécessaires
à son existence. Gagnant fort peu dans ses travaux de palais, il
n’aurait pas voulu ajouter à la gêne de sa position en contractant
des dettes; il était fort rangé, toujours avec une petite réserve
d’économies qui lui permettait de rendre des services sans en
demander lui-même. Après son frugal repas chez un traiteur,
dont la maison était nommée l’<i>Hôtel de la Modestie</i>, il prenait une
demi-tasse de café et jouait quelques parties de dominos. Ajoutez,
de temps en temps, le spectacle d’une tragédie classique au
Théâtre-Français, voilà toute la defense et tous les amusements
du jeune avocat.</p>

<p>“Un café où se rendait le plus habituellement Danton s’appelait
<i>Café de l’École</i>, parce qu’il était situé sur ce quai, presque au
coin de la place qui a conservé ce nom. C’était un rendez-vous
très fréquenté par les hommes de loi qui se trouvaient rapprochés
du Châtelet et du Palais de Justice. La rigueur du costume et
de la coiffure, espèce de signalement perpétuel, avait cet avantage
qu’on n’était pas tenté de se commettre.</p>

<p>“Les maîtres des cafés, alors peu nombreux dans Paris, étaient
eux-mêmes des bourgeois d’honnête allure. Ils maintenaient le
bon ton de leur maison par leur civilité. Ils faisaient rarement
fortune, à l’exception de deux ou trois qui étaient de premier
rang. Le <i>Café de l’École</i> n’était pas précisément à ce niveau; mais
il était l’un de ceux qui avaient la meilleure réputation. Nous
croyons voir encore le maître de la maison avec sa petite perruque
ronde, son habit gris et sa serviette sous le bras. Il était rempli
de prévenances pour ses clients, et il en était traité avec une considération
cordiale. Une femme des plus recommandables et fille
de la maison, aussi douce que gracieuse, tenait le comptoir.
Parmi les habitués, qui paraissaient s’arrêter avec un intérêt<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_358"></a>[358]</span>
particulier à ce comptoir, on put remarquer un jeune avocat qui,
d’abord fort gai et jovial, parut quelque temps après plus sérieux.
Ce jeune avocat était Danton; il avait cru d’abord ne causer que
généralement et sans conséquence avec les dames du comptoir;
son cœur s’y était pris, et Danton était amoureux. Mademoiselle
Gabrielle Charpentier n’avait pas songé à se défier des assiduités
de Danton; elle se trouva bientôt, à son insu, préoccupée du
même sentiment. Sans être dans le secret de cette inclination, le
père et la mère Charpentier ne furent pas très surpris quand la
main de leur fille leur fut demandée par le jeune avocat. La
vivacité de son caractère leur fit craindre un moment de consentir
à cette union; mais il avait su toucher le cœur de Gabrielle.
Lorsqu’on disait: <i>Qu’il est laid!</i> elle répétait, presque comme
l’avait dit une femme au sujet de Lekain: <i>Qu’il est beau!</i> Elle
admirait son esprit, que l’on trouvait trop piquant; son âme, que
l’on trouvait trop ardente; sa voix, que l’on trouvait forte et
terrible, et qu’elle trouvait douce.</p>

<p>“Il fallait cependant prendre des renseignements sur ce prétendant.
M. Charpentier visita particulièrement les procureurs
chez qui Danton avait travaillé, et les avocats avec lesquels il
avait été en rapport au barreau. Il n’y eut qu’une voix en sa
faveur. D’après des renseignements aussi satisfaisants, les bons
parents ne s’informèrent point de sa fortune; ils y tenaient peu,
quoique en ayant eux-mêmes une assez modeste. Pourtant, ils
donnaient en mariage à leur fille une somme de 40,000 francs, ce
qui était pour l’époque une dot considérable. Ils imposaient à
leur gendre une seule condition, c’est qu’il exerçât un état; c’est
qu’il fût <i>occupé</i>. La profession d’avocat au parlement était sans
doute une profession honorable et libre, mais trop libre peut-être,
et qui ne commandait pas un travail assez assidu. Danton promit
de remplir les vœux de son beau-père; il s’exprima dans des
termes si chaleureux, que le père et la mère Charpentier se mirent
à aimer Danton presque autant que leur fille.</p>

<p>“Des amis de Danton lui conseillèrent d’acheter une charge
d’avocat aux conseils. M. et Madame Charpentier offrirent généreusement
la dot de leur fille; mais ce n’était que 40,000 francs,
et il en fallait 80,000! Des Champenois dévoués proposèrent
de compléter ce qui manquait pour le payement de la charge.</p>

<p>“Ils s’en rapportaient tous à la délicatesse et à la probité de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_359"></a>[359]</span>
Danton; sa bonne conduite était sa caution. Le mariage n’ayant
plus de cause de retard, les bans publiés, le consentement de sa
mère arrivé d’Arcis-sur-Aube, Georges-Jacques Danton et Gabrielle
Charpentier furent unis, et le même jour il entra, comme il le
disait gaiement, <i>en puissance de femme et en charge d’officier ministériel;
le même jour, mari et avocat aux conseils</i>.</p>

<p>“Les avocats aux conseils réunissaient les doubles fonctions
d’avocats et de procureurs; ayant peu de procédure à faire, ils
avaient l’avantage de rester maîtres de leurs affaires et de ne pas
subir, comme les avocats des autres cours, la loi d’un procureur
préoccupé du désir d’attirer à lui tous les bénéfices. Les fonctions
des avocats aux conseils avaient aussi quelque chose d’éminemment
propre à élever l’âme des jeunes gens; leur mission consistait
souvent à redresser les torts du parlement et des cours supérieures.
Ils communiquaient journellement avec les maîtres des requêtes,
avec les conseillers d’État, avec les hommes du plus haut rang, qui
étaient obligés de recourir à leur ministère pour lutter contre les
usurpations dont ils avaient à se plaindre.</p>

<p>“Les avocats aux conseils avaient ainsi l’occasion, en discutant
avec les ministres eux-mêmes, soit pour les attaquer, soit pour les
défendre, d’apprendre à connaître les rapports des autorités entre
elles, la vraie distinction des pouvoirs, l’organisation civile dans
toute son étendue, l’ordre social dans son ensemble: c’était une
excellente école pour créer des économistes, des politiques, des
législateurs.</p>

<p>“En exposant le rôle et la mission des avocats aux conseils,
nous aurions peut-être dû expliquer que tels étaient au moins la
pensée et le droit de l’institution. Faut-il constater maintenant
ce qu’était en fait l’institution? Sur le nombre de soixante
membres composant l’honorable confrérie, on voyait plusieurs
hommes distingués qui sentaient la dignité de leurs fonctions,
traitaient leurs clients avec générosité et délicatesse, les affaires avec
science, application et courage. Mais tous, il faut bien le dire,
n’avaient pas un sentiment aussi élevé de leurs devoirs, et il en était
quelques-uns dont l’émulation consistait à faire beaucoup de <i>grosses</i>.</p>

<p>“Au moment où Danton fut reçu avocat aux conseils, c’était
en 1787; il avait vingt-huit ans, sa femme en avait vingt-cinq.
Dans ce moment, l’Ordre était divisé en trois partis plus ou moins
actifs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_360"></a>[360]</span></p>

<p>“Les anciens voulaient créer un <i>syndicat</i>, à la tête duquel ils
auraient été tout naturellement placés.</p>

<p>“Les jeunes arrivants appartenaient aux idées nouvelles, et ne
voulaient être ni conduits ni éconduits.</p>

<p>“Un troisième parti se composait des hommes modérés et
pacifiques qui, aimant le repos avant tout, et, comme on a dit
depuis, <i>la paix partout et toujours</i>, ne voulaient se mêler à aucune
action et préféraient laisser faire le mal à leur détriment plutôt
que de se mouvoir en aucun sens et se laisser déranger même par
un progrès qui leur eût été utile, mais qui aurait pu les <i>désheurer</i>.</p>

<p>“On a déjà pressenti à quel parti Danton avait dû se rallier.
Il ne méconnaissait pas la discipline qui doit présider à la bonne
organisation d’une compagnie judiciaire; mais il croyait que la
force et la puissance réelles des compagnies sont dans leur indépendance,
comme le talent même des membres de ces corporations
ne peut se passer de la dignité du caractère.</p>

<p>“L’homme qui, en entrant dans une compagnie, dessine ses
opinions avec une énergique rudesse, peut s’attendre à rencontrer
bien des luttes et bien des hostilités.</p>

<p>“Voulant juger la valeur du nouvel arrivant, les avocats, sous
prétexte de bienvenue, et sans l’avoir averti à l’avance, lui firent
subir une épreuve en latin. On lui imposa pour sujet l’exposé de
la situation morale et politique du pays dans ses rapports avec la
justice. C’était, comme Danton l’a dit depuis, <i>lui proposer de
marcher sur des rasoirs</i>.... Il ne recula point. Saisissant
même comme une bonne fortune la difficulté inattendue dans
laquelle on croyait l’enlacer, il s’en tira avec éclat, et laissa ses
auditeurs dans l’étonnement de sa présence d’esprit et de la
décision de son caractère. Il ne craignit point d’aborder la
politique qui commençait a pénétrer en toute affaire, et qui était
peut-être ici une cause secrète du piège qui lui était tendu. On
espérait surprendre en défaut un jeune avocat qui levait la tête et
annonçait des principes d’indépendance. Danton, en homme de
talent habile à triompher des plus grandes difficultés, osa parler
des choses les plus actuelles; il dit que, comme citoyen ami de
son pays, autant que comme membre d’une corporation consacrée
à la défense des intérêts privés et publics de la société, il désirait
que le gouvernement sentît assez la gravité de la situation pour y
porter remède par des moyens simples, naturels et tirés de son<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_361"></a>[361]</span>
autorité; qu’en présence des besoins impérieux du pays, il fallait
se résigner à se sacrifier; que la noblesse et le clergé, qui étaient
en possession des richesses de la France, devaient donner l’exemple;
que, quant a lui, il ne pouvait voir dans la lutte du parlement, qui
éclatait alors, que l’intérêt de quelques particuliers puissants qui
combattaient les ministres, mais sans rien stipuler au profit du
peuple. Il déclarait qu’à ses yeux l’horizon apparaissait sinistre,
et qu’il sentait venir une révolution terrible. Si seulement on
pouvait la reculer de trente années, elle se ferait amiablement par
la force des choses et le progrès des lumières. Il répéta dans ce
discours, qui ressemblait au cri prophétique de Cassandre: <i>Malheur
à ceux qui provoquent les révolutions, malheur à ceux qui les font!</i></p>

<p>“Plusieurs fois les vieux avocats qui avaient tendu ce piège à
Danton voulurent interrompre son improvisation. Ils avaient cru
entendre des mots qui les effrayaient, tels que <i>motus populorum,
ira gentium, salus populi suprema lex</i>.... Les jeunes gens qui,
récemment sortis des collèges, avaient le droit de comprendre le
latin mieux que les anciens, qui l’avaient oublié ou ne l’avaient
jamais su, répondaient à leurs vieux confrères qu’ils avaient mal
entendu, que le récipiendaire était resté dans une mesure parfaite,
irréprochable.</p>

<p>“Espérant constater plus facilement dans le texte d’une rédaction
écrite les pensées imprudentes qu’ils avaient cru saisir en
écoutant ses paroles, les anciens demandèrent que Danton déposât
son discours de réception sur la table de la chambre du conseil.
Danton répondit qu’il n’avait rien écrit. Il avait déjà pour système
d’écrire le moins possible. Ainsi qu’il l’a dit depuis, on n’écrit
point en révolution. Il ajouta d’ailleurs que si l’on désirait porter
un jugement sur les paroles qu’il avait prononcées, il ne prétendait
pas s’y opposer. Il était assez certain de sa pensée et de sa
mémoire pour répéter avec fidélité toute son improvisation....
Le reméde eût été pire que le mal. L’aréopage trouva que c’était
déjà bien assez de ce qu’on avait entendu, et la majorité s’opposa
avec vivacité à la récidive.</p>

<p>“Le cabinet acheté par Danton était loin, au moment où il en
devint titulaire, de posséder une clientèle nombreuse. Il n’en fut
pas moins toujours d’un grand désintéressement vis-à-vis de ses
clients.</p>

<p>“Il se montrait peu exigeant dans la question des honoraires,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_362"></a>[362]</span>
même lorsqu’il avait gagné sa cause. Lorsque son client venait
s’acquitter envers lui, il lui arrivait souvent de dire: <i>c’est trop</i>, et
de rendre ce qu’il appelait <i>le trop</i>. Dans certaines affaires perdues,
il refusait toute rémunération. ‘Je n’ai point de déboursés,
disait-il, puisque je n’ai point fait d’écritures, et que j’ai laissé à
la régie son papier timbré.’ Il lui arrivait, bien qu’il ne fût pas
riche, de donner lui-même des secours d’argent à des clients
malheureux.</p>

<p>“Une pareille conduite ne mène pas rapidement à la fortune.
Cependant le cabinet de Danton s’améliora en très peu de temps.
En dirigeant dignement ses affaires, il gagnait de vingt à vingt-cinq
mille francs par an; son sort de père de famille était assuré.</p>

<p>“Dans ce temps où la France était encore divisée en provinces,
les classes inférieures pouvaient se réclamer des grands seigneurs
de leur pays, et ceux-ci aimaient souvent par vanité autant que
par humanité à protéger leurs vassaux. La maison de Brienne
était de Champagne, près Arcis-sur-Aube. Danton était connu du
comte de Brienne, ancien ministre de la guerre, et de l’archevêque
de Sens, alors premier ministre. Il comptait parmi ses clients M.
de Barentin. Il avait des conférences avec lui pour ses affaires
particulières, et plusieurs fois, après les avoir traitées, M. de
Barentin s’entretenait avec son avocat des affaires publiques. La
manière supérieure dont Danton voyait les choses avait frappé
M. de Barentin et lui avait laissé une vive impression de sa
capacité.</p>

<p>“Devenu garde des sceaux, M. de Barentin se souvint aussitôt
de son avocat et lui fit demander s’il voulait être secrétaire de la
chancellerie? Danton, dans un long entretien qu’il eut avec ce
ministre, lui exposa avec détails un plan qu’il croyait pouvoir
éloigner les déchirements que l’opposition des parlements allait
enfanter. Quelques-uns de ces parlements venaient d’être exilés:
Danton pensait que leur rappel n’était pas une chose de la plus
grande urgence. Il fallait avant tout les enlacer dans la participation
aux réformes; ils en étaient autant les adversaires que la
noblesse et le clergé, dont ils faisaient en quelque sorte partie et
dont ils avaient les privilèges. Tous les privilégiés enfin, quels
que fussent leurs costumes, qu’ils eussent un manteau de noblesse,
une soutane de prêtre ou une robe de palais, tous, selon l’opinion
de Danton, devaient contribuer aux charges qui ne pesaient que<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_363"></a>[363]</span>
sur le tiers État, c’est-à-dire sur l’immense majorité; la nation
attendait l’allégement du fardeau intolérable qu’elle ne pouvait
plus supporter, la résignation était épuisée....</p>

<p>“Si ces idées étaient acceptées, le roi, étant à leur tête, se
trouverait conquérir dans l’intérêt de tous une puissance supérieure
à tous les intérêts particuliers. Il pourrait réaliser les demandes
de la raison et donner, par un progrès réel, toute satisfaction aux
lumières du siècle et à la philosophie, interprète des vrais besoins
de l’humanité.</p>

<p>“En résumé, le plan conçu par Danton tendait à faire accomplir
par le roi une réforme progressive qui, laissant en place les
pouvoirs établis, les rendit, à leur insu ou malgré eux, les instruments
de cette équité pratique qui aurait fortifié à la fois tous les
organes du mécanisme social. M. de Barentin parla du projet de
Danton à l’archevêque de Sens. On parut l’approuver. Dans
l’intervalle, la cour répudia ce système trop net et trop décisif
pour ses allures. Le parlement fut rappelé. Brienne croyait en
avoir gagné les principaux membres.</p>

<p>“Mais trois mois après—novembre 1787—lorsque le roi fut
obligé de venir à Paris tenir un lit de justice à ce même parlement
pour obtenir l’enregistrement d’un édit portant création de divers
emprunts jusqu’à concurrence de 450 millions, Louis XVI rencontra
la plus violente opposition dans cette cour qu’on croyait réduite.
Il voulut vaincre l’opposition en exilant les plus récalcitrants, les
conseillers Fréteau, Sabatier, de Cabre et le duc d’Orléans....
Au mois de mai suivant, 1788, le même parlement rendit un arrêt
qui réclama avec véhémence ‘les lois fondamentales de l’État; le
droit de la nation d’accorder des subsides, le droit des cours du
royaume de vérifier les édits, de vérifier dans chaque province les
volontés du roi, et de n’en accorder l’enregistrement qu’autant
qu’elles seraient conformes aux lois constitutives de la province,
ainsi qu’aux fondamentales de l’État; l’immovabilité et l’indépendance
des magistrats, le droit pour chaque citoyen de n’être
jamais traduit en aucune manière devant d’autres juges que ses
juges naturels désignés par la loi; le droit, sans lequel tous les
autres sont inutiles, de n’être arrêté, par quelque ordre que ce soit,
que pour être remis sans délai entre les mains des juges compétents;
protestant la cour du parlement contre toute atteinte qui
serait portée aux principes exprimés.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_364"></a>[364]</span></p>

<p>“M. de Barentin proposa de nouveau a Danton d’être secrétaire
du sceau. Celui-ci remercia en disant que l’état de la
question politique était changé. ‘Nous n’en sommes plus aux
réformes modestes; ceux qui les ont refusées ont refusé leur
propre salut; nous sommes, dit-il plus nettement que jamais, à
la veille d’une révolution. Eh quoi! ne voyez-vous pas venir
l’avalanche?...</p>

<span class="smaller">EXTRACTS FROM DOCUMENTS<br />
<span class="smcap">Showing the Price Paid for Danton’s Place at the Conseils du
Roi, the Sources from which he Derived the Money for
its Payment, and the Compensation Paid on its Suppression
in 1791.</span></span></h3>

</div>

<p>The three documents from which I quote below are of
the utmost importance to a special study of Danton, because
they give us most of our evidence as to the value of
his post at the Conseils du Roi, and permit us to understand
his financial position during the first years of the
Revolution.</p>

<p>They are three in number:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The deed of sale by which Danton acquired the
post from Me. Huet de Paisy. This deed was discovered
by Dr. Robinet (from whose “Vie Privée de Danton” I
take all the documents quoted) in the offices of a Parisian
solicitor, Me. Faiseau-Jaranne of the Rue Vivienne. This
gentleman was the direct successor in his business of the
M. Dosfant who drew up the deed seventy years before.</p>

<p>I have quoted only the essential portions of this exceedingly
interesting piece of evidence. They give us the date
of the transaction (March 29, 1787), the price paid, 78,000
livres, or rather (seeing that Danton acquired the right to
collect a debt of 11,000) 67,000 livres net (say £2600); the
fact that some £2000 of this was paid down out of a
loan raised for him by his relations in Champagne and his
future father-in-law, while some £160 he paid out of his
savings, and the rest remained owing. The receipt of
1789, which I have attached at the end of the extract,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_366"></a>[366]</span>
shows us that by that time the balance had been paid
over to Me. Huet de Paisy, including interest at 5 per
cent. Incidentally there is mention of Danton moving
to the Rue de la Tissanderie, whence we shall find him
drawing up his marriage-contract.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The marriage-contract between Danton and Antoinette
Charpentier, contains all the customary provisions
of a French marriage-contract, and is witnessed by the
usual host of Mends, such as we find witnessing Desmoulins’
contract, three or four years later. It tells us,
among other things, the position of his stepfather Recordain
and the well-to-do connections of the Charpentiers;
but the point of principal interest is the dowry—20,000
livres, that is, some £800—of which the greater
part (£600) went to pay his debt on the place he held
as Avocat ès Conseils, and the fact that he had remaining
a patrimony of some £500.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The acknowledgment of the sum due as compensation
to Danton when the hereditary and purchasable office
which he had bought was put an end to. All students of
the period know the vast pother that has been raised on
this point, the rumour that Danton was overpaid as a
kind of bribe from the court, &amp;c. &amp;c. All the direct
evidence we have of the transaction is in these few lines.
They are just like all the other forms of reimbursement,
and are perfectly straightforward.</p>

<p>The amount is somewhat less than we should give in
England under similar circumstances, for (1) the State
does not allow for the entrance-fees (10,000 livres), which
Danton had had to pay, and (2) it taxes him 12 per
cent. for the <i>probable</i> future taxation which would have
fallen by death, transference, &amp;c., on the estate. Finally,
he gets not quite 70,000 livres for a place which cost him
first and last 78,000.</p>

<p>To recapitulate: the general conclusions which these
documents permit us to draw with regard to Danton’s
financial position are as follows:—The price of the practice<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_367"></a>[367]</span>
he bought was 68,000 livres; of this, 56,000 was paid down,
a sum obtained by borrowing 36,000 from Mdlle. Duhattoir
(a mortgagee discovered by the family solicitor, Millot), and
15,000 from his future father-in-law, Charpentier, the remaining
5000 being paid out of his own pocket.</p>

<p>He thus remains in debt to Me. Huet de Paisy, the
vendor, in a sum of 12,000 livres at 5 per cent. interest.</p>

<p>To this must be added a sum of 10,000 livres entrance-fee,
which he presumably pays by recovering a debt of
somewhat larger amount (11,000) which he had bought
along with the practice.</p>

<p>When he marries, his wife’s dowry cancels his debt to
Charpentier and leaves him 5000 livres over, he possessing
at that time in land and houses at Arcy some 12,000—in
all 17,000 livres or their value are in hand in the summer
of 1787, and his total liabilities at the same date are the
36,000 to Mdlle. Duhattoir and the 12,000 to Me. de Paisy.
He starts his practice, therefore, with 31,000 livres, or about
£1200 of net liability. The practice was lucrative; we
know that he is immediately concerned with three important
chancery cases; he becomes the lawyer of two of
the wealthiest men in the kingdom; he lives modestly.
We know that he pays the 12,000 with interest in
December 1789, and though we do not possess the receipt
for Mdlle. Duhattoir’s repayment, it is eminently probable
that, under such conditions, he could easily have met a
debt of less than £800 out of four years’ successful practice
in a close corporation, which of necessity dealt with the
most lucrative cases in the kingdom. I think, therefore, one
may regard the reimbursement which he received in 1791
as presumably free from debt, and see him in no financial
difficulty at any period of the Revolution. This opinion
has the advantage of depending upon the support of all
those who have lately investigated the same documents—MM.
Aulard, Robinet, earlier Bougeart (but he is a special
pleader), and finally Mr. Morse Stephens in England.</p>

<span class="smaller">EXTRACTS FROM DOCUMENTS<br />
<span class="smcap">Showing the Situation of Danton’s Apartment in the Cour
de Commerce, its Furniture and Value, &amp;c.</span></span></h3>

</div>

<p>The extracts given below are of a purely personal interest,
and do not add anything material to our knowledge
of the Revolution. On the other hand, they are of value
to those who are chiefly concerned with Danton’s personality,
and with the details of his daily life. They show
what kind of establishment he kept, with its simple furniture,
its two servants, its reserve of money, &amp;c., and enable
us to make an accurate picture of the flat in which he
lived, and of its position. It is from them that I have
drawn the material for my description of the rooms in
Appendix II. on p. 329. Incidentally, they tell us the
profession of M. Charpentier’s brother (a notary), give us a
view of the religious burial practised in the spring of 1793,
show us, as do many of his phrases elsewhere, the entire
absence of anti-clericalism in Danton’s family as in his
own mind, the number of the house, the name of its proprietor,
Danton’s wardrobe, his wine, the horse and carriage
which he bought for his hurried return from Belgium, and
many other petty details which are of such interest in the
study of an historical character.</p>

<p>Like most of the documents quoted in this Appendix,
they are due to the industry and research of Danton’s
biographer, Dr. Robinet, and will be found in his Memoir
on Danton’s private life. They are three in number:—</p>

<p>(<i>a</i>) The various declarations of Thuiller, the justice of
the peace for the Section du Théâtre Français. He put<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_374"></a>[374]</span>
seals upon the doors and furniture (as is the French
custom) upon the death of Danton’s first wife. This death
occurred on February 11, 1793, while Danton was away
on mission in Belgium, and the visit of the justice of the
peace is made on the following day, the 12th. Danton
returns at once, and the seals are removed on various
occasions, from the 24th of March to the 5th of April, in
the presence of Danton himself, or of his father-in-law,
Charpentier.</p>

<p>(<i>b</i>) The inventory which accompanied the sealing and
unsealing of the apartments.</p>

<p>(<i>c</i>) The raising of the seals which were put upon the
house after Danton’s execution. Interesting chiefly for the
astonishing writing and spelling of the new functionaries.</p>

<p>All the three were obtained by Dr. Robinet from the
lawyers who have succeeded to, or inherited from, the
original “Etudes” where the documents were deposited.</p>

<p>The rest of the inventory mentions the household linen,
the clothes, the plate, and the jewels. The summary
is as follows:—</p>

  <tr>
    <td>Household linen, in all</td>
    <td class="tdpg">734</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Clothes, including every item</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Knives and forks other than plate</td>
    <td class="tdpg">20</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Jewellery (including two women’s rings, set with brilliants,
    and a wedding-ring)</td>
    <td class="tdpg">509</td>
  </tr>
</table>

<p>This gives us the whole value of the furniture, clothing, &amp;c., in
the house, and it amounts to a total of just over 9000 livres,
that is, about £360. There was £50 in money in the house,
which he had left with his wife before going off to Belgium.</p>

<span class="smaller">CATALOGUE OF DANTON’S LIBRARY</span></h3>

</div>

<p>No part of the very scanty evidence we possess upon
Danton’s personal life and habits is of more value than this
little list. It is the small and carefully chosen bookcase
of a man thoroughly conversant with English and Italian
as well as with his own tongue. He buys a work in the
original almost invariably, and collects, in a set of less than
two hundred works, classic after classic. He has read his
Johnson and his Pope; he knows Adam Smith; he has
been at the pains to study Blackstone. It must be carefully
noted that every book he bought was his own choice.
There were only a few legal summaries at the old home at
Arcis, and Danton was a man who never had a reputation
for learning or for letters, still less had he cause to buy a
single volume for effect. I know of few documents more
touching than this catalogue, coming to the light after
seventy years of silence, and showing us the mind of a man
who was cut off suddenly and passed into calumny. He
had read familiarly in their own tongues Rabelais and
Boccaccio and Shakespeare.</p>

<span class="smaller">EXTRACTS FROM THE MEMOIR WRITTEN IN 1846 BY THE SONS OF DANTON</span></h3>

</div>

<p>This memoir was written by Danton’s sons. Both survived
him, the one by fifty-five, the other by sixty-four years
(1849, 1858). Their fortune was restored to them by the
Republic two years after their father’s death (13th April
1796). Their guardian, Charpentier (their maternal grandfather),
died in 1804; they then were taken in by Danton’s
mother, Mme. Recordain, who was still living at Arcis.
She died in October 1813, a year in which the youngest
came of age, and they sold out the greater part of the land
in which Danton’s fortune had been invested, and appear
to have put the capital into one of the new factories which
sprang up after the peace. In 1832 we find them partners
and heads of a cotton-spinning establishment at Arcis,
which they maintain till their deaths. They left, unfortunately,
no surviving sons.</p>

<p>The manuscript was written for Danton’s nephew, the
son of a younger brother. This nephew became inspector
of the University of Paris, and lent the MSS. to several
historians, among others, Michelet and Bougeart. It finally
passed into the possession of the latter, who gave it to Dr.
Robinet. This writer printed it in the appendix of the
“Vie Privée,” from which I take it.</p>

<p>It is not a precise historical document, such as are the
official reports, receipts, &amp;c., upon which much of this book
depends. Thus, it ignores the dowry of Mdlle. Charpentier
and the exact date of the second marriage; it is weak on
some points, especially dates, but there attaches to it the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_385"></a>[385]</span>
interest due to the very quality from which these errors
proceed—I mean its familiar reminiscences. While the
memory of these men, advanced in life, is at fault in details,
it is more likely to be accurate in the motives and tendencies
it describes than are we of a hundred years later.</p>

<p>“Rien au monde ne nous est plus cher que la mémoire de notre
père. Elle a été, elle est encore tous les jours calomniée, outragée
d’une manière affreuse; aussi notre désir le plus ardent a-t-il toujours
été de voir l’histoire lui rendre justice.</p>

<p>“Georges-Jacques Danton, notre père, se maria deux fois. Il
épousa d’abord en juin 1787, Antoinette-Gabrielle Charpentier,
qui mourut le 10 février 1793. Dans le cours de cette même
année 1793, nous ne pourrions pas indiquer l’époque precise, il
épousa, en secondes noces, Mademoiselle Sophie Gély, qui vivait
encore il y a deux ans (nous ne savons pas si elle est morte depuis).
Notre père en mourant ne laissa que deux fils issus de son premier
mariage. Nous sommes nés l’un le 18 juin 1790, et l’autre le
2 février 1792; notre père mourut le 5 avril 1794; nous n’avons
donc pas pu avoir le bonheur de recevoir ses enseignements, ses
confidences, d’être initiés à ses pensées à ses projets. Au moment
de sa mort tout chez lui a été saisi, confisqué, et plus tard, aucun
de ses papiers, à l’exception de ses titres de propriété, ne nous a
été rendu. Nous avons été élevés par M. François-Jérôme Charpentier,
notre grand-père maternel et notre tuteur. Il ne parlait
jamais sans attendrissement de Danton, son gendre. M. Charpentier,
qui habitait Paris, y mourut en 1804, à une époque où, sans
doute, il nous trouvait encore trop jeunes pour que nous puissions
bien apprécier ce qu’il aurait pu nous raconter de la vie politique
de notre père, car il s’abstint de nous en parler. Du reste, il avait
environ quatre-vingts ans quand il mourut; et, dans ses dernières
années, son esprit paraissait beaucoup plus occupé de son avenir
dans un autre monde que de ce qui s’était passé dans celui-ci.
Après la mort de notre grand-père Charpentier, M. Victor Charpentier,
son fils, fut nommé notre tuteur. Il mourut en 1810.
Quoiqu’il habitât Paris, nous revînmes en 1805 à Arcis, pour ne
plus le quitter. La fin de notre enfance et le commencement de
notre jeunesse s’y écoulèrent auprès de la mère de notre père. Elle
était affaiblie par l’âge, les infirmités et les chagrins. C’était toujours<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_386"></a>[386]</span>
les yeux remplis de larmes qu’elle nous entretenait de son
fils, des innombrables témoignages d’affection qu’il lui avait donnés,
des tendres caresses dont il l’accablait. Elle fit de fréquents voyages
à Paris; il aimait tant à la voir à ses côtés! Il avait en elle une
confiance entière; elle en était digne, et, s’il eût eu des secrets,
elle les eût connus, et nous les eussions connus par elle. Très
souvent elle nous parlait de la Révolution; mais, en embrasser
tout l’ensemble d’un seul coup d’œil, en apprécier les causes, en
suivre la marche, en juger les hommes et les événements, en distinguer
tous les partis, deviner leur but, démêler les fils qui les
faisaient agir, tout cela n’était pas chose facile, on conviendra:
aussi, quoique la mère de Danton eût beaucoup d’intelligence et
d’esprit, on ne sera pas surpris que, d’après ses récits, nous n’ayons
jamais connu la Révolution que d’une manière extrêmement confuse...</p>

<p>“Sa mère, d’accord avec tous ceux qui nous ont si souvent parlé
de lui pour l’avoir connu, et que notre position sociale ne fera,
certes, pas suspecter de flatterie, sa mère nous l’a toujours dépeint
comme le plus honnête homme que l’on puisse rencontrer, comme
l’homme le plus aimant, le plus franc, le plus loyal, le plus désintéressé,
le plus généreux, le plus dévoué à ses parents, à ses amis,
à son pays natal et à sa patrie. Quoi d’étonnant, nous dira-t-on?
Dans la bouche d’une mère, que prouve un pareil éloge? Rien,
sinon qu’elle adorait son fils. On ajoutera: Est-ce que pour juger
un homme la postérité devra s’en rapporter aux déclarations de la
mère et des fils de cet homme? Non, sans doute, elle ne le devra
pas, nous ne convenons. Mais aussi, pour juger ce même homme
devra-t-elle s’en rapporter aux déclarations de ses ennemis? Elle
ne le devra pas davantage. Et pourtant que ferait-elle si, pour
juger Danton, elle ne consultait que les ‘Mémoires’ de ceux qu’il
a toujours combattus?...</p>

<p>“On a reproché à Danton d’avoir exploité la Révolution pour
amasser scandaleusement une fortune énorme. Nous allons prouver
d’une manière incontestable que c’est à très grand tort qu’on lui a
adressé ce reproche. Pour atteindre ce but, nous aliens comparer
l’état de sa fortune au commencement de la Révolution avec l’état
de sa fortune au moment de sa mort.</p>

<p>“Au moment où la Révolution éclata, notre père était avocat
aux conseils du Roi. C’est un fait dont il n’est pas nécessaire de<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_387"></a>[387]</span>
fournir la preuve: ses ennemis eux-mêmes ne le contestent pas.
Nous ne pouvons pas établir d’un manière précise et certaine ce
qu’il possédait à cette époque, cependant nous disons que, s’il ne
possédait rien autre chose (ce qui n’est pas prouvé) <i>il possédait au
moins sa charge</i>, et voici sur ce point notre raisonnement:—</p>

<p>“(1ᵒ) Quelques notes qui sont en notre possession nous prouvent
que Jacques Danton, notre grand-père, décédé a Arcis, le 24 février
1762, laissa des immeubles sur le finage de Plancy et sur celui
d’Arcis, il est donc présumable que notre père, né le 26 octobre
1759, et par consequent resté mineur en très bas âge, a dû posséder
un patrimoine quelconque, si modique qu’on veuille le supposer.”...</p>

<p>[Here follow guesses as to how he paid for his place in the
<i>Conseils</i>. They are of no importance now, as we possess the documents
which give us this (p. 365). The only point of interest in
the passage omitted is the phrase, “probably our mother brought
some dowry.” We know its amount (p. 366), but the sentence
is an interesting proof of the complete dislocation which Germinal
produced in the family.]</p>

<p>“Nous allons établir que ce qu’il possédait au moment de sa
mort n’était que l’équivalent à peu près de sa charge d’avocat aux
conseils. Nous n’avons jamais su s’il a été fait des actes de partage
de son patrimoine et de celui de ses femmes, ni, si, au moment de
la confiscation de ses biens, il en a été dressé inventaire, mais nous
savons très-bien et très-exactement ce que nous avons recueilli de
sa succession, et nous allons le dire, sans rester dans le vague sur
aucun point, car c’est ici que, comme nous l’avons annoncé, nos
arguments vont être basés sur des actes authentiques.</p>

<p>“Nous ferons observer que l’état que nous allons donner comprend
sans distinction ce qui vient de notre père et de notre mère.</p>

<p>“Une loi de février 1791 ordonna que le prix des charges et
offices supprimés serait remboursé par l’État aux titulaires. La
charge que Danton possédait était de ce nombre. Nous n’avons
jamais su, pas même approximativement, combien elle lui avait
coûté. Il en reçut le remboursement sans doute, car précisément
vers cette époque, il commença à acheter des immeubles dont voici
le detail:—</p>

<p>“Le 24 mars 1791, il achète aux enchères, moyennant quarante-huit
mille deux cents livres, un bien national provenant du clergé,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_388"></a>[388]</span>
consistant en une ferme appelée Nuisement, située sur le finage de
Chassericourt, canton de Chavanges, arrondissement d’Arcis, département
de l’Aube, à sept lieues d’Arcis.... Danton avait
acheté cette ferme la somme de quarante-huit mille deux cents,
ci</p>

<p class="right">48,200 liv.</p>

<p class="right"><span class="spacer">———</span></p>

<p class="right"><span class="spacer">A reporter</span> 48,200 liv.</p>

<p>“12 avril 91.—II achète aux enchères du district
d’Arcis, par l’entremise de maître Jacques Jeannet-Boursier....</p>

<p>[Then follows a list of purchases made in the month of April
1791, of which the most important is an extension to the house at
Arcis—the total of these is 33,600 livres; and in October 1791 a
few acres of land in the town and a patch of wood for 3160 livres.
Then follows the sum total.]</p>

<p>“Total du prix de toutes les acquisitions d’immeubles faites
par Danton en mil sept cent quatre-vingt-onze: quatre-vingt-quatre
mille neuf cent soixante livres, ci</p>

<p class="right">84,960 liv.</p>

<p>“On doit remarquer qu’il est présumable que la plus grande
partie de ces acquisitions a dû être payée en assignats qui, à cette
époque, perdaient déjà de leur valeur et dont, par conséquent, la
valeur nominale était supérieure à leur valeur réelle en argent,
d’où il résulterait que le prix réel en argent des immeubles ci-dessus
indiqués aurait été inférieur à 84,960 livres.</p>

<p>“Depuis cette dernière acquisition du 8 novembre 1791 jusqu’à
sa mort, Danton ne fit plus aucune acquisition importante:—...</p>

<p>[Here then is what Danton left.]</p>

<p>“(1ᵒ) La ferme de Nuisement (vendue par nous le 23 juillet
1813);</p>

<p>“(2ᵒ) Sa modeste et vieille maison d’Arcis, avec sa dépendance,
le tout contenant non plus 9 arpents, 3 denrées, 14 carreaux
(ou bien 4 hectares, 23 ares, 24 centiares) seulement, comme au
13 avril 1791, époque où il en fit l’acquisition de Mademoiselle
Piot, mais par suite des additions qu’il y avait faites, 17 arpents,
3 denrées, 52 carreaux (ou bien 786 ares, 23);</p>

<p>“(3ᵒ) 19 arpents, 1 denrées, 41 carreaux (898 ares, 06) de pré
et saussaie;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_389"></a>[389]</span></p>

<p>“(4ᵒ) 8 arpents, 1 denrée, 57 carreaux (369 ares, 96) de bois;</p>

<p>“(5ᵒ) 2 denrées, 40 carreaux (14 ares, 07) de terre située dans
l’enceinte d’Arcis.</p>

<p>“Nous déclarons à qui voudra l’entendre et au besoin nous
déclarons <i>sous la foi du serment</i>, que nous n’avons recueilli de la
succession de Georges-Jacques Danton, notre père, et d’Antoinette-Gabrielle
Charpentier, notre mère, rien, absolument rien autre
chose que les immeubles dont nous venons de donner l’état, que
quelques portraits de famille et le buste en plâtre de notre mère,
lesquels, longtemps après la mort de notre second tuteur, nous
furent remis par son épouse, et que quelques effets mobiliers qui
ne méritent pas qu’on en fasse l’énumeration ni la description,
mais que nous n’en avons recueilli aucune somme d’argent, aucune
créance, en un mot rien de ce qu’on appelle valeurs mobilières, à
l’exception pourtant d’une rente de 100 fr. 5 p. 100 dont MM.
Defrance et Détape, receveurs de rentes à Paris, rue Chabannais,
nᵒ 6, ont opéré la vente pour nous le 18 juin 1825, rente qui avait
été achetée pour nous par l’un de nos tuteurs....</p>

<p>“On pourra nous faire une objection qui mérite une réponse;
on pourra nous dire: Vous n’avez recueilli de la succession de votre
père et de votre mère que les immeubles et les meubles dont vous
venez de faire la déclaration, mais cela ne prouve pas que la fortune
de votre père, au moment de sa mort, ne se composât que de ces
seuls objets; car sa condamnation ayant entraîné la confiscation de
tous ses biens sans exception, la République a pu en vendre et en
a peut-être vendu pour des sommes considérables. Vous n’avez
peut-être recueilli que ce qu’elle n’a pas vendu.</p>

<p>“Voici notre réponse:—</p>

<p>“Les meubles et les immeubles confisqués à la mort de notre
père dans le département de l’Aube et non vendus, furent remis
en notre possession par un arrêté de l’administration de ce département,
en date du 24 germinal an IV. (13 avril 1796), arrêté dont
nous avons une copie sous les yeux, arrêté pris en conséquence
d’une pétition présentée par notre tuteur, arrêté basé sur la loi du
14 floréal an III. (3 mai 1795), qui consacre le principe de la
restitution des biens des condamnés par les tribunaux et les commissions<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_390"></a>[390]</span>
révolutionnaires, basé sur la loi du 21 prairial an III. (9
juin 1795), qui lève le séquestre sur ces biens et en règle le mode
de restitution; enfin, arrêté basé sur la loi du 13 thermidor an III.
(31 juillet 1795), dont il ne rappelle pas les dispositions.</p>

<p>“L’administration du département de l’Aube, dans la même
délibération, arrête que le produit des meubles et des immeubles
qui ont été vendus et des intérêts qui ont été perçus depuis le 14
floréal an III. (3 mai 1795), montant à la somme de douze mille
quatre cent cinq livres quatre sous quatre deniers, sera restitué à
notre tuteur, en bons au porteur admissibles en payement de
domaines nationaux <i>provenant d’émigrés seulement</i>. Nous ne
savons pas si notre tuteur reçut ces bons au porteur; s’il les reçut,
quel usage il en fit; nous savons seulement qu’il n’acheta pas de
biens d’émigrés. Il résulte évidemment de cet arrêté de l’administration
du département de l’Aube, que dans ce département le
produit des meubles et immeubles provenant de Danton et vendus
au profit de la République, ne s’est pas élevé au-dessus de 12,405
livres 4 sous 4 deniers. C’était le total de l’état de réclamation
présenté par notre tuteur dans sa pétition, et tout le monde pensera,
comme nous, qu’il n’aura pas manqué de faire valoir tous
nos droits. On peut remarquer que dans cet arrêté il est dit que
ces 12,405 livres sont le montant du produit des meubles et des
immeubles vendus, et des <i>intérêts</i> qui ont été perçus depuis le 14
floréal an III. (3 mai 1795).... Mais si d’un côté on doit ajouter
12,405 livres, d’un autre côté on doit retrancher 16,065 livres qui
restaient dues aux personnes qui ont vendu à notre père les
immeubles dont nous avons hérité....</p>

<p>“Il est donc établi d’abord que dans le département de l’Aube,
le prix des meubles et des immeubles qui ont été vendus n’a pas
pu s’élever au-dessus de 12,405 livres; ensuite que notre père, au
moment de sa mort, devait encore 16,065 livres sur le prix d’acquisition
des immeubles qu’il y possédait....</p>

<p>“Maintenant nous allons citer quelques faits <i>authentiques</i> qui
pourront faire apprécier la bonté de son cœur. Nous avons vu
précédemment que ce fut en mars et en avril 1791 qu’il acheta la
majeure partie, on pourrait même dire la presque totalité des
immeubles qu’il possédait quand il mourut.</p>

<p>“Voici un des sentiments qui agitaient son cœur en mars et en
avril 1791. Il désirait augmenter la modeste aisance de sa mère,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_391"></a>[391]</span>
de sa bonne mère qu’il adorait. Veut-on savoir ce qu’il s’empressa
de faire à son entrée en jouissance de ces immeubles qu’il venait
d’acheter? Jetons un regard sur l’acte que nous tenons dans les
mains. Il a été passé le 15 avril 1791 (deux jours après la vente
faite à Danton par Mademoiselle Piot) par-devant Mᵉ Odin que en
a gardé la minute, et Mᵉ Étienne son collègue, notaires à Troyes.
Danton y fait donation entre-vifs, pure, simple et irrévocable, à sa
mère de six cents livres de rentes annuelles et viagères, payables
de six mois en six mois, dont les premiers six mois payables au 15
octobre 1791. Sur cette rente de 600 livres, Danton veut qu’en
cas de décès de sa mère, 400 livres soient reversibles sur M. Jean
Recordain, son mari (M. Recordain était un homme fort aisé
lorsqu’il épousa la mère de Danton; il était extrêmement bon, sa
bonté allait même jusqu’à la faiblesse, puisque, par sa complaisance
pour de prétendus amis dont il avait endossé des billets, il perdit
une grande partie de ce qu’il avait apporté en mariage, néanmoins
c’était un si excellent homme, il avait toujours été si bon pour les
enfants de Jacques Danton, qu’ils le regardaient comme leur
véritable père; aussi Danton, son beau-fils, avait-il pour lui beaucoup
d’affection). Le vif désir que ressent Danton de donner aux
donataires des marques certaines de son amitié pour eux, est la
seule cause de cette donation. Cette rente viagère est à prendre
sur la maison et sur ses dépendances, situées à Arcis, que Danton
vient d’acquérir le 13 avril 1791. Tel fut son premier acte de
prise de possession.</p>

<p>“On remarquera que cette propriété, au moment où Mademoiselle
Piot la vendit, était louée par elle à plusieurs locataires
qui lui payaient ensemble la somme de 600 livres annuellement.
Si Danton eût été riche et surtout aussi riche que ses ennemis ont
voulu le faire croire, son grande cœur ne se fût pas contenté de
faire à sa mère une pension si modique. Pour faire cette donation
Danton aurait pu attendre qu’il vint à Arcis; mais il était si pressé
d’obéir au sentiment d’amour filial qu’il éprouvait que, dès le 17
mars 1791, il avait donné à cet effet une procuration spéciale à M.
Jeannet-Bourcier, qui exécuta son mandat deux jours après avoir
acheté pour Danton la propriété de Mademoiselle Piot. Aussitôt
que la maison était devenue vacante et disponible, Danton, qui
aimait tant être entouré de sa famille, avait voulu que sa mère et
son beau-père vinssent l’habiter, ainsi que M. Menuel, sa femme<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_392"></a>[392]</span>
et leurs enfants (M. Menuel avait épousé la sœur aînée de
Danton).</p>

<p>“Au 6 août 1792 Danton était a Arcis; on était à la veille
d’un grand événement qu’il prévoyait sans doute. Au milieu des
mille pensées qui doivent alors l’agiter, au milieu de l’inquiétude
que doivent lui causer les périls auxquels il va s’exposer, quelle
idée prédomine, quelle crainte vient l’atteindre? Il pense à sa
mère, il craint de n’avoir pas suffisamment assuré son mort et sa
tranquillité; en voici la preuve dans cet acte passé le 6 août 1792
par-devant Mᵉ Finot, notaire à Arcis. Qu’y lit-on? ‘Danton
voulant donner à sa mère des preuves des sentiments de respect et
de tendresse qu’il a toujours eus pour elle, il lui assure, sa vie
durant, une habitation convenable et commode, lui fait donation
entre-vifs, pure, simple et irrévocable, de l’usufruit de telles parts
et portions qu’elle voudra choisir dans la maison et dépendances
situées à Arcis, rue des Ponts, qu’il a aquise de Mademoiselle Piot
de Courcelles, et dans laquelle maison sa mère fait alors sa demeure,
et de l’usufruit de trois denrées de terrain à prendre dans tel
endroit du terrain qu’elle voudra choisir, pour jouir desdits objets
à compter du jour de la donation. Si M. Jean Recordain survit à
sa femme, donation lui est faite par le même acte de l’usufruit
de la moitié des objets qu’aura choisis et dont aura joui sa
femme....</p>

<p>“Voici encore une pièce, peu importante en elle-même à la
vérité, mais qui honore Danton et qui prouve sa bonté: c’est un pétition
en date du 30 thermidor an II. (17 août 1794), adressée
aux citoyens administrateurs du département de Paris, par Marguerite
Hariot (veuve de Jacques Geoffroy, charpentier à Arcis),
qui expose que par acte passé devant Mᵉ Finot, notaire à Arcis, le
11 décembre 1791, Danton, dont elle était la nourrice, lui avait
assuré et constitué une rente viagère de cent livres dont elle devait
commencer à jouir à partir du jour du décès de Danton,
ajoutant que, de son vivant, il ne bornerait pas sa générosité à
cette somme. Elle demande, en conséquence, que les administrateurs
du département de Paris, ordonnent que cette rente viagère
lui soit payée à compter du jour du décès et que le principal en
soit prélevé sur ses biens confisqués au profit de la République.
Nous ne savons pas ce qui fut ordonné. Cette brave femme, que
notre père ne manquait jamais d’embrasser avec effusion et à<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_393"></a>[393]</span>
plusieurs reprises chaque fois qu’il venait à Arcis, ne lui survécut
que pendant peu d’années.</p>

<p>“La recherche que nous avons faite dans les papiers qui nous
sont restés de la succession de notre grand’mère Recordain, papiers
dont nous ne pouvons pas avoir la totalité, ne nous a fourni que
ces trois pièces <i>authentiques</i> qui témoignent en faveur de la bonté
de Danton dans sa vie privée. Quant aux traditions orales que
nous avons pu recueillir, elles sont en petit nombre et trop peu
caractéristiques pour être rapportées. Nous dirons seulement que
Danton aimait beaucoup la vie champêtre et les plaisirs qu’elle
pent procurer. Il ne venait à Arcis que pour y jouir, au milieu
de sa famille et de ses amis, du repos, du calme et des amusements
de la campagne. Il disait dans son langage sans recherche, à
Madame Recordain, en l’embrassant: ‘Ma bonne mère, quand
aurai-je le bonheur de venir demeurer auprès de vous pour ne plus
vous quitter, et n’ayant plus à penser qu’à planter mes choux?’</p>

<p>“Nous ne savons pas s’il avait des ennemis ici, nous ne lui en
avons jamais connu aucun. On nous a très-souvent parlé de lui
avec éloge; mais nous n’avons jamais entendu prononcer un mot
qui lui fût injurieux, ni même défavorable, pas même quand nous
étions au collège; là pourtant les enfants, incapables de juger la
portée de ce qu’ils disent, n’hésitent pas, dans une querelle
occasionnée par le motif le plus frivole, à s’adresser les reproches
les plus durs et les plus outrageants. Nos condisciples n’avaient
donc jamais entendu attaquer la mémoire de notre pere, il
n’avait donc pas d’ennemis dans son pays.</p>

<p>“Nous croyons ne pas devoir omettre une anecdote qui se rapporte
à sa vie politique. Nous la tenons d’un de nos amis qui l’a
souvent entendu raconter par son père, M. Doulet, homme très recommandable
et très digne de foi, qui, sous l’Empire, fut longtemps
maire de la ville d’Arcis. Danton était à Arcis dans le
mois de novembre 1793. Un jour, tandis qu’il se promenait dans
son jardin avec M. Doulet, arrive vers eux une troisième personne
marchant à grands pas, tenant un papier à la main (c’était un
journal) et qui, aussitôt qu’elle fut à portée de se faire entendre,
s’écrie: Bonne nouvelle! bonne nouvelle! et elle s’approche.—Quelle
nouvelle? dit Danton.—Tiens, lis! les Girondins sont
condamnés et exécutés, répond la personne qui venait d’arriver.—Et
tu appelles cela une bonne nouvelle, malheureux? s’écrie Danton<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_394"></a>[394]</span>
à son tour, Danton, dont les yeux s’emplissent aussitôt de
larmes. La mort des Girondins une bonne nouvelle? Misérable!—Sans
doute, répond son interlocuteur; n’était-ce pas des factieux?—Des
factieux, dit Danton. Est-ce que nous ne sommes
pas des factieux? Nous méritons tous la mort autant que les
Girondins; nous subirons tous, les uns après les autres, le même
sort qu’eux. Ce fut ainsi que Danton, le Montagnard, accueillit
la personne qui vint annoncer la mort des Girondins, auxquels
tant d’autres, en sa place, n’eussent pas manqué de garder
rancune....</p>

<p>“La France aujourd’hui si belle, si florissante, te placera alors
au rang qui t’appartient parmi ses enfants généreux, magnanimes,
dont les efforts intrépides, inouïs, sont parvenus à lui ouvrir, au
milieu de difficultés et de dangers innombrables, un chemin à la
liberté, à la gloire, au bonheur. Un jour enfin, Danton, justice
complète sera rendue à ta mémoire! Puissent tes fils avant de
descendre dans la tombe, voir ce beau jour, ce jour tant désiré.”</p>

<span class="smaller">NOTES OF TOPINO-LEBRUN, JUROR OF THE REVOLUTIONARY TRIBUNAL</span></h3>

</div>

<p>The interest of these notes is as follows:—They are the
only verbatim account of the trial which we possess. There
are of course the official accounts (especially that of
Coffinhal), and upon them is largely based the account in
M. Wallon’s <i>Tribunal Révolutionnaire</i>; but these rough
and somewhat disconnected notes, badly spelt and abbreviated,
were taken down without bias, and as the words
fell from the accused. Topino-Lebrun, the painter, was at
that time thirty-one years of age, a strong Montagnard of
course; he hesitated to condemn Danton, but was overborne
by his fellows, especially by his friend and master David.</p>

<p>These notes were kept at the archives of the Prefecture
of Police until the year of the war. In 1867 M. Labat
made copies, and gave one to Dr. Robinet, and one to M.
Clarétie. Each of these writers has used them in their
works on the Dantonites. The original document was
burnt when, in May 1871, the Commune attempted to
destroy the building in which they were preserved.</p>

<p>There are given below only those portions which directly
refer to Danton and his friends.</p>

Que l’accusateur (Fouquier-Tinville) qui m’accuse d’après la Convention,
administre la preuve, les semi-preuves, les indices de ma
vénalité! J’ai trop servi; la vie m’est à charges. <i>Je demande
des commissionaires de la Convention pour recevoir ma dénonciation
sur le système de dictature.</i></p>

<p>J’ai été nommé administrateur par un liste triple, le dernier,
par de bons citoyens en petit nombre [that is, substitute in
December 1790].</p>

<p>Je forçai Mirabeau, aux Jacobins, de rester à son poste; je l’ai
combattu, lui qui voulait s’en retourner à Marseille.</p>

<p>Où es ce patriote, qu’il vienne, je demande a être confondu,
qu’il paraisse, j’ai empêché le voyage de Saint-Cloud, j’ai été décrété
de prise de corps pour le Champ de Mars.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_397"></a>[397]</span></p>

<p>J’offre de prouver le contraire [that is, the contrary of St.
Just’s statement that he was unmolested when he fled to
Arcis] et lisez la feuille de l’orateur: Des assassins furent envoyés
pour m’assassiner à Arcis, l’une a été arrêté.—Un huissier vint
pour mettre le décret à execution, je fuyais done, et le peuple
voulut en faire justice.—J’etais à la maison de mon beau-père;
on l’investit, on maltraita mon beau-frère pour moi, je me sauvais
(<i>sic</i>) à Londres, je suis revenu lorsque Garran fut nommé. On
offirit à Legendre 50,000 écus pour m’égorger. Lorsque les Lameth
... devenu partisans de la cour, Danton les combattit aux
Jacobins, devant le peuple, et demanda la République.</p>

<p>Sous la législature je dis: la preuve que c’est la cour qui veut
la guerre c’est qu’elle a [a word illegible] l’initiative et la
sanction. Que les patriotes se rallient et alors si nous ne pouvons
vous vaincre nous triompherons de l’Europe (?).</p>

<p>—Billaud-Varennes ne me pardonne pas d’avoir été mon secrétaire.
Quelle proposition avez-vous faite contre les Brissotins?—La
loi de Publicola! Je portai le cartel à Louvet, qui refusa. Je manquai
d’être assassiné à la Commune.—J’ai dit a Brissot, en plein,
Conseil, tu porteras la tête sur l’echafaud, et je l’ai rappelé ici à
Lebrun.</p>

<p>—J’avai préparé le 10 août et je fus à Arcis, parce que Danton
est bon fils, passer trois jours, faire mes adieux à ma mere et régler
mes affaires il y a des témoins.—On m’a revu solidement, je ne
me suis point couché. J’étais aux Cordeliers, quoique substitut
de la Commune. Je dis au ministre Clavières, que venait de la
part de la Commune, que nous allions sonner l’insurrection. Après
avoir réglé toutes les opérations et le moment de l’attaque, je me
mis sur le lit comme un soldat, avec ordre de m’avertir. Je sortis
à une heure et je fus à la Commune devenue revolutionnaire. Je
fis l’arrêt de mort contre Mandat, qui avait l’ordre de tirer sur le
peuple. On mit le maire en arrestation et j’y restais (<i>sic</i>) suivant
l’avis des patriotes. Mon discours à l’Assemblée législative.</p>

<p>—Je faisais la guerre au Conseil; je n’avais que ma voix,
quoique j’eusse de l’influence.</p>

<p>—Mon parent, qui m’accompagna en Angleterre [Mergez, a
volunteer in 1792, and later a general of Napoleon’s] avait
dix huit ans.</p>

<p>—Je crois encore Fabre bon citoyen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_398"></a>[398]</span></p>

<p>—J’atteste que je n’ai point donné ma voix à d’Orléans, qu’on
prouve que je l’ai fait nommer.</p>

<p>—J’eûs 400 mille f. sur les 2 millions pour faire la rev., 200
mille livres pour choses secrêtes. J’ai dépensé devant Marat et
Robespierre pour tous les commissaires des departements. Calomines
de Brissot. J’ai donne 6000 a Billaud pour aller à l’armée.
Les autres 200 mille, j’ai donné ma comptabilité de 130 mille et
le reste je l’ai remis.</p>

<p>... Fabre la disponibilité de payer les commissaires, parce
que Billaud-Varenne avait de refusé (<i>sic</i>).</p>

<p>Il n’est pas à ma connaissance que Fabre prêcha la fédéralisme.</p>

<p>—J’embrasserais mon ennemi pour la patrie, à laquelle je donnerais
mon corps à dévorer.</p>

<p>Je nie et prouve le contraire. Ce fut Marat qui m’envoya un
porte feuille et les pièces, et j’avais fait arrêter Duport. Se a
été jugé à Melun, d’après une loi. Liu et Lameth out voulu me
faire assassiner. Ministre de la Justice, j’ai fait executer la loi.
Pour mon fait, je n’avais pas de preuves judiciaires.</p>

<p>—La guerre feinte n’est que depuis quinze jours, et le Brissotins
m’ont pardieu bien attaqué. Lisez le <i>Moniteur</i>. Barbaroux a fait
demander par le bataillon de Marseille ma tête et celles de Marat
et de Robespierre. Marat avait son caractère volcanisé, celui de
Robespierre tenace et ferme, et moi, je servais à ma manière.—Je
n’ai vu qu’une fois Dumourier, qui me tâta pour le ministre:
je repondis que je ne le serais qu’on bruit de canon. Il m’ecrivit
ensuite.—Placé là, Kelerman (<i>sic</i>) voulait passer la Marne et
Dumourier ne le voulait pas; embarrassé et mon dictateur, je
soutins le plan de Dumourier, qui reussit.—Craignant la jalousie
de deux généraux, j’envoyai Fabre, etc.... avait vu Vesterman,
au 10, le sabre à la main.</p>

<p>—Je talonnai Servan et Laenée; je n’ai connu de plan militaire
que celui de Dumourier et de Kelerman, et Billaud fut nommé
par moi pour surveiller Dumourier; il eu a rendu compte à la
législature et aux Jacobin. Ordre d’examiner ce que c’etait...
cette retraite (<i>sic</i>). La Convention a envoyé trois commissaires.</p>

<p>—Moi, ministre, j’embrassais la masse et les détails de la Justice.</p>

<p>—Billaud m’a dit qu’il ne savait pas si Dumourier était un
traître; d’ailleurs c’était une surabondance de patriotisme.</p>

<p>—Sur, la Belgique, répète son dire aux Jacobins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_399"></a>[399]</span></p>

<p>—Le piège des Brissots était de faire croire que nous desorganisions
les armées.</p>

<p>—On me refuse des temoins, allons je ne me défends plus!</p>

<p>—Je vous fais d’ailleurs mille excuses de ce qu’il y a de trop
chaud, c’est mon caractère.</p>

<p>—Le peuple dechirera par morceaux mes ennemis avant trois
mois.</p>

</div>

<h4><span class="smcap">Séance du 15 Germinal (4 Avril).</span></h4>

<div class="blockquote">

<p><i>Hérault.</i> Sur le petit Capet, nie le fait.—Il fut nommé pour
la partie diplomatique avec Barrère. Déclare que jamais il ne
s’est mêlé de negociations. Nie avoir jamais fait imprimer aucune
chose en diplomatie. Deforgues envoya Dubuisson.</p>

<p><i>Hérault.</i> Je ne conçois rien à ce galimathias. Je me suis
opposé a l’envoi de Salavie. C’est un moyen employé par nos
ennemis. Envoyé dans le Bas-Rhin par le Comité, je travaillè
(<i>sic</i>) avec Berthelemy (<i>sic</i>) à la neutralité de la Suisse et j’ai sauvé
à la Republique un armée de soixante-mille hommes.—Jamais je
n’ai communiqué a Proly rien en politique, il n’y en avait pas.
Au surplus, il fallait me confronter avec Proly.—J’ai été trompé
comme j’a jaie st fois [J. Jay St. Foix] comme la Convention,
comme jam bon [this does not mean <i>ham</i>, but Jean-Bon St.
André], qui le voulait emmener secretaire, comme Colot. Comme
Marat, Proly a été porté en triomphe. La Convention, par un
decret solemnel, a reçu mes explications. Anacharsis me dit
vient (<i>sic</i>) dîner avec moi, dîner avec Dufourni, etc.... J’ai
laissé la veuve Chemineau, etc. L’huillier! c’est à l’instigation
de Clootz.</p>

<p>J’ai connu l’abbé guillotiné en troie [that is, in Troyes]
(<i>sic</i>), dans mon exil il était chanoine et non refractaire. C’est
donc un plaisanterie. Il n’etait pas soumis au serment, il m’avait
assisté dans mon exil.</p>

<p>Au 14 juillet, à la Bastille, j’ai eu deux hommes tués à mes
côtés. Maltraité par mes parents, j’ai voyage, j’ai été incarcéré
trois semaines en Sardaigne et je suis revenu.</p>

<p><i>Camille.</i> Lors de sa dispute avec Saint-Just, celui-ce lui
dit qu’il le ferait périr,—j’ai denoncé Dumourier avant Marat;
d’Orleans, le premier, j’ai ouvert la Revolution et ma mort va la
fermer.—Marat s’est trompé sur Proly. Quel est l’homme qui<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_400"></a>[400]</span>
n’a pas eu son Dilon? Depuis le nᵒ 4 [that is, of the <i>Vieux
Cordelier</i>] je n’ai écris (<i>sic</i>) que pour me rétracter. J’ai
attaché le grelot à toutes les factions. On m’a encouragé! écrit
(<i>sic</i>) etc. demasque la faction Hébert, il est bon que quelqu’un
le fasse.</p>

<p><i>Lacroix.</i> Sur la déclaration de Miajenski, rappelle qu’il l’a
confondu, que la Convention a été satisfaite, et qu’il n’a pas été
accusé pour cela. Il dit: je fus envoyé a Liége pour connaître
des reproches faits à la Tresorerie, et vice-versà. Nous étions
trois. Jamais je n’ai vu Dumourier en présence de Dumourier
(au lieu de Miacrinski?). J’ai dit a Miajenski, sa legion manquant
de tout, que je appuyerais devant mes collègues, mais qu’il
etait étonnant que sur le pays ennemi ou ne décrétât pas que les
troupes étrangerès fussent payées. Je n’ai ni bu, ni mangé avec
Dumourier. Vu pendant six à sept jours toujours ensemble.
Danton, Gossuin et moi nous avions visité toutes les caisses de la
Belgique pour examiner les faits.—Dumourier ne voulait point
prêter les mains au decrêt, je me levai et lui déclarai que s’il ne
signait pas à l’heure, nous le ferions garrotter, etc. Il signa
l’ordre à Ronsin.—La seconde fois nous nous rendîmes à Bruxelles,
Dumourier était en Hollande.—Tous mes collègues ont attesté que
je preposai de me laisser aller auprès de Dumourier l’observer et
le tuer mes collègues ne furent pas de cet avis.</p>

<p>.. 1900 et 600 livres de linge acheté par Brune en présence
des collègues, pour la table. Il etait à bon marché. Il dut
être chargé sur les voitures que ramenaient en France les restitutions
des effets pillés par les généraux, c’était contenu dans une
malle à mon addresse. Je l’ai declaré alors au comité de Salut.
Alors je l’ai réclamée. Ne confondez pas la première voiture
d’argenterie qui fut pillé, elle etait expédiée par tous nos
collègues.</p>

<p><i>Danton.</i> J’avais défié publiquement d’entrer en explication
sur l’imputation des 400,000. Il résulte du procès-verbal qu’il
n’y a à moi que mes chiffons et un corset molleton. <i>Le bas</i>,
sommé, m’a donné communication.</p>

<p>Appelé aux Jacobins par mes collègues, je déclarais (<i>sic</i>) que
le renouvellement était contre-revolutionnaire: ce que portait (<i>sic</i>)
les pouvoirs des envoyés des sociétés populaires.—Billaud-Varennes
m’appuya et je fus chargé de faire la proposition le 11 à la<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_401"></a>[401]</span>
Convention.—Hébert, le lendemain, me dénonça dans sa feuille; et
voilà le principe de la calomnie.</p>

<p>Je fus indigné, au 31 mai, de voir un officier qui disait: il
n’y a ni Marais, ni Montagne; qui distribuait de l’argent au
bataillon de Courbevoie; je ... témoin Panis, Legendre, Robespierre,
Pache, Robert-Lindet. Alors je montais (<i>sic</i>) à la tribune,
etc. ... que nous n’etions pas libres. Au Comité, devant Pache,
le 2 juin, j’ai improuvé la mesure maladroite de Hauriot. Nous
l’avions prévenu qu’en rentrant nous décréterions les 32, mais que
ce n’était pas assez pour la chose publique, qu’il fallait purger la
Convention, et a proposé 500,000 livres pour l’armée de Paris que
avait sauvé la patrie. Barère s’y opposa. C’est Barère qui a
proposé le décret d’accusation contre Hauriot; c’est moi qui ai
défendu Hauriot contre cela. Qu’on entende les témoins, la Convention
a été trompée.</p>

<p>—J’ai appelé l’insurrection en demandant cinquante revolutionnaires
comme moi. La Convention m’appuya, l’avais dit trois
mois avant, il n’y a plus de paix avec les Girondins, ai-je la face
Hypocrite?</p>

<p>Hanriot crut que j’etais opposé à l’insurrection et alors je lui
dis: vas toujours ton train, n’aie pas peur, nous voulons constater
que l’Assemblée est libre.</p>

<p>—Je n’ai jamais bu ni mangé avec Mirande, et je proposai à mes
collègues de l’arrêter, il s’y opposerent.</p>

<p>Je pris la main à Hanriot et lui dis: tiens bon.</p>

<p><i>Hérault.</i> C’est moi qui ai découvert l’ordre signé au crayon
par Hauriot pour laisser passer la Convention, ainsi, etc.</p>

<p><i>Philippeaux.</i> Arrivé de mon dépt j’ignorais les intrigues, je
fus trompé par Roland. Je me suis rétracté à temps.—Lorsque je
m’aperçus du piége tendu dans l’appel au peuple, je montai à la
tribune et j’abjurai et votai de suite comme la Montagne. J’ai
voté pour Marat (c’est faux, il n’a voté ni pour ni contre). Le
Comité ne répondant point à mes lettres, je suis venu ici. Le
Comité ne m’a point entendu. Alors, pour remplir mon devoir,
j’ai écrit à la Convention, et l’événement, sur Hébert, a prouvé,
etc. On a fait contre moi des adresses contre moi (<i>sic</i>) etc. On
a envoyé de chez moi trois commissaires pour connaître les faits et
Levasseur les a fait arrêter.</p>

<p><i>Vesterman.</i> Lorsque Dumouriez etait en Belgique j’etais au<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_402"></a>[402]</span>
Hollande. Abandonné entre les ennemis, vivant de pillage, je
suis arrivé à Envers (<i>sic</i>) avec ma legion. Le regiment de cavalrie
fut attaqué. Je repoussai l’ennemi.</p>

<p>Accusé de venir deux et trois fois apporter les dépêches de
Dumourier à Gensonné.</p>

<p>L’armée manquait de souliers, je fus envoyé par Dumourier au
Conseil, et je les rapportai à l’armée.</p>

<p>Dumourier lui montra la lettre de roi de Prusse pour son
secretaire, qu’il avait renvoyé, je courus après lui et l’arrêtai de
mon pouvoir. Le second voyage pour porter le pli des articles
arrêté (<i>sic</i>) entre les généraux.</p>

<p>Il a encore été envoyé en otage à Mons, lors de l’evacuation.—Troisième
voyage pour amener Malus et d’Espagnac, et porta un
pacquet (<i>sic</i>) au président du comité diplomatique.—J’ai denoncé
au (<i>sic</i>) Jacobins, au Comité le fils naturel de Proly, et on me rit
au nez. Il engagea au déjeuné (<i>sic</i>) pour rétablien Dumourier
aux Jacobins. Pourquoi ne m’a-t-on pas appelé lors de la déposition
de Miajenski? J’etais ici, mandé à la barre. Dumourier
m’a toujours éloigné de lui. A protesté sur la capitulation
d’Anvers. Sur le fait de Lille.</p>

<p>Avant d’arriver à Menhem Proly me denonca. Ici, on me
mis (<i>sic</i>) hors de la loi et un officier prussien me montra la feuille
de la Convention et m’engagea à rester, qu’on me payerait, et
chercha à m’effrayer en disant que les autres généraux avaient été
massacrés. Voir au comité militaire. Je fus à Lille avec ma
troupe. Je trouvai Mouton et vint (<i>sic</i>) prendre son ordre pour
venir à la barre.—J’ai prêté serment avant, à Douai. Le décret
du 4 mai dit qu’il n’y avait lieu à m’accuser. J’étais dénoncé aur
comités, je ne connais point Talma.</p>

<p><i>Danton.</i> C’est Barère qui est patriote à present et Danton
aristocrate. La France ne croira pas cela longtemps.</p>

<p><i>Danton, dans la chambre des accusés.</i>—Moi conspirateur?
Mon nom est accoté de toutes les institutions révolutionnaires:
levée, armée rév., comité rév., comité de salut public, tribunal
révolutionnaire, C’est moi qui me suis donné la mort, enfin, et je
suis un modéré!</p>

<span class="smaller">REPORT OF THE FIRST COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC SAFETY<br />
TREATING OF THE GENERAL CONDITION OF THE REPUBLIC, AND READ BY BARRÈRE TO
THE CONVENTION ON WEDNESDAY, MAY 29, 1793</span></h3>

</div>

<p>This report is the most important appendix not only to this book,
but to any description of the two days that expelled the Girondins.
It is here published for the first time, and, though of some length,
will well repay the reading for any student of the Revolution.</p>

<p>I have dwelt sufficiently on its importance in the text, and I
can dismiss it here with a short introduction.</p>

<p>It is the first great result of the Committee which Danton had
helped to create, and of which he was the soul. It is the first step
taken by this new organ of government towards that dictatorship
to exercise which it had been called into existence. The enormous
amount of detailed work necessary to produce it shows us the
number of agents which the Committee must have possessed, and
their activity, as well as the industry of the members themselves,
for it had been at work but eight weeks.</p>

<p>Danton undoubtedly inspired the tone and direction of the
report, but the somewhat florid style is Barrère’s own. Dr.
Robinet thinks, however, that the last pages, from the section on
Public Instruction onwards, are in Danton’s manner, and M.
Boruard would even put it at the section on the Colonies, two
pages earlier. Even if this is the case, some sentences at least
were put in by Barrère, for they betray his inimitable verbiage, to
which Danton was a stranger.</p>

<p>Of the important part the report played in the complicated<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_404"></a>[404]</span>
history of the week May 26-June 3, 1793, enough has been said in
the text; it is only necessary to add here that no speech or memoir
contains such an indictment of the Girondin misgovernment as is
given indirectly by this list of ascertained facts in the condition
of France.</p>

<p>The reading of the report is mentioned in the <i>Moniteur</i> of May
31, but, contrary to their custom, they did not print it on account
of its great length. It seems to have been read in the afternoon
from about two to four, just before Cambon’s motion was put to
the vote. I give the more important passages, about half the full
length of the document.</p>

<p class="center">CONVENTION NATIONALE</p>

<p class="center">RAPPORT GÉNÉRAL<br />
SUR<br />
L’ÉTAT DE LA RÉPUBLIQUE FRANÇAISE</p>

<p class="center"><i>Fait, au nom du Comité de Salut Public, dans la seance du<br />
mercredi 29 mai, l’an second de la République</i>:</p>

<p class="center"><i>Par Barrère</i>,</p>

<p class="center"><i>Député du département des Hautes-Pyrénées</i></p>

<p class="center"><i>Imprimé par ordre de la Convention Nationale</i></p>

<p><span class="smcap">Citoyens</span>,—Chargés par les représentans du peuple de leur parler
aujourd’hui des grands intérêts qui les rassemblent, et des moyens que
nous avons employés depuis deux mois pour le salut de la patrie en
péril; nous réclamons d’abord de votre justice de remonter par la
pensée, à l’èpoque de notre nomination, et de vous rappeler en quel
état se trouvaient alors la République et toute les parties d’administration
nationale.</p>

<p>Quoiqu’accablés par la tâche périlleuse et grande que vous nous avez
imposée, nous avons dû obéir. Votre confiance, notre zèle et l’amour
de notre pays ont dû nous tenir lieu de facultés.</p>

<p>Au-dehors se présentait une guerre terrible à soutenir sur des frontières
d’une étendue immense et sur des côtes indéfendues. Audedans,
se propageaient des dissensions civiles, portant avec elles les deux
caractères les plus funestes, le fanatisme royal et religieux, secouru par
des perfidies multipliées dans l’intérieur, et par des intelligences combinées
audehors.</p>

</div>

<p>What follows is a general indictment of the results of
Girondin rule, with special and particular attacks on the
Ministry of War and on their fear of responsibility.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>On voyait dans toutes nos armées des besoins impérieux et sans
cesse renaissans; des secours nuls ou tardifs; des approvisionnemens<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_406"></a>[406]</span>
insuffisans ou de mauvaise qualité et des administrations dévorantes,
dont quelques-unes, n’ont d’autre but réel que d’agrandir la fortune de
beaucoup d’agioteurs et de quelques capitalistes. Dans nos ports des
travaux ralentis et une inertie coupable; partout des trahisons ourdies
et des coalitions préparées; des états-majors à refaire ou à épurer; des
armées à organiser ou à improviser; des fonctionnaires civils et militaires
à surveiller ou à remplacer; des forces à créer sur tous les points
menacés par les troubles; des armes à fabriquer; des canons à fondre;
la marine à créer; l’esprit public à remonter avec énergie; l’anarchie à
attaquer; la discipline à rétablir; des mouvemens contra-révolutionnaires
à comprimer et un cahos d’intérêts, de plaintes, de passions,
d’abus, de prétentions et de préjugés à débrouiller, au milieu d’une
correspondance journalière et centuplée par ces circonstances actuelles.
Quel vast génie ou quel courage inépuisable il eût fallu pour répondre
tout à coup à des circonstances aussi extraordinaires ou pour dominer
des évènemens aussi imprévus? Nous avons borné notre tâche à parcourir
d’abord toutes les parties du gouvernement provisoire, et à nous
frayer ensuite une route au milieu de cet assemblage énorme de forces
et de résistances, de bons et de mauvais principes.</p>

<p>Le premier obstacle qui s’est présenté à nous, est venu du changement
dans le ministère de la guerre, que avait précédé notre établissement.</p>

<p>Le second obstacle était dans le ministère de la marine négligé,
anéanti même, par un série de ministries royaux, et dont nous avons été
forcés de faire changer le chef et plusieurs adjoints.</p>

<p>Là s’est rompue, pour nous, la chaîne des opérations de ces deux
départemens, les plus importans dans un temps de guerre de terre et de
mer; et nous nous sommes vus privés, tout à coup, de toutes les ressources
de l’expérience. Nous n’avons pu recueillir, dans l’agglomération
des affaires de cette partie de l’administration publique, que des états
inexacts ou des lumières incertaines.</p>

<p>Un aperçu des délibérations du conseil exécutif nous a montré, d’un
côté, des travaux incohérens qui n’ont pu avoir aucune espèce de succès
à cause des évènemens qui les dominaient; de l’autre, des négligences
funestes et des fautes graves que les évènemens suivants ont mieux fait
sentir. Depuis les bouches de l’Escaut, ouvertes par un usurpation de
la puissance souveraine, jusqu’aux extrémités de la Méditerranée, qui
ont été le théâtre de nos revers, et de la versatilité ministérielle, nous
n’avons vu ni cette suite d’opérations qui assurent les succès, ne cette
prévoyance des mesures qui diminuent les revers. Point d’ensemble,
point de conceptions vastes, point de vues hardies, point de plan arrêté,
point d’énergie, et partout la terreur de la responsabilité, marchant en
avant du ministère, tandis qu’il s’agit de marcher fièrement à la liberté,
sans regarder en arrière.</p>

<p>Au mois d’octobre, la résistance à l’ennemi avait donné des conceptions
et des forces au conseil exécutif.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_407"></a>[407]</span></p>

<p>Les succès du mois de novembre ont amolli le conseil. Jemmappes
a été pour les ministres (<i>sic</i>) la Capoue qui a détruit son énergie et
atténué ses travaux.</p>

<p>Le département de l’intérieur, machine trop lourde, trop compliquée
pour un homme, quand il serait plein de talens et de moyens d’exécution,
avait refroidi pendant longtemps l’esprit public et engourdi les
corps administratifs. Il était impossible que la main d’un seul homme
pût remuer cette machine énorme surchargée de details, d’une administration
immense, d’opérations mercantiles dont le succès est douteux,
dont le résultat exige de grands sacrifices, et dont le secret appelle la
défiance. La seule ressource que ce ministère disproportionné pouvait
trouver, était dans les administrateurs départementaires, dont la plupart,
insoucians sur les travaux qui leur sont confiés, négligent de
correspondre, ou dont la conduite exagérée et sans mesure leur faisait
méconnaître toute subordination.</p>

<p>Le département de la guerre, dans lequel chaque ministre a porté ses
préjugés et ses assertions, ses routines et ses haînes; le ministère de la
guerre désorganisé sans cesse par la fréquente mutation de ses agens et
par la diversité de leurs principes ou de leurs opinions, présentait et
présent encore un chaos inextricable, des abus sans nombre, et une impuissance
réelle dans tout homme que ne serait pas né très actif dans
la manière d’ordonner et entreprenant sur tous les moyens de défense.</p>

</div>

<p>In what follows note the hand of Danton, almost his
phraseology in the second paragraph.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Le ministère des affaires étrangères, couvert d’obscurités politiques,
ne pouvant avoir au milieu des défiances produites par la révolution et
des mouvemens irréguliers de la guerre, ni fixité dans les opérations, ni
vues suivies, ni projets déterminés, ni secrets dans les plans, a saisi
seulement le fil de quelques affaires importantes, et redonne maintenant
de l’activité aux moyens nombreux dont l’intérêt de plusieurs gouvernemens
prépare le succès.</p>

<p>C’est de l’audace dans les conceptions politiques, c’est de l’ensemble
dans les mesures, c’est de la promptitude dans les moyens d’exécution,
que dépend la diplomatie nouvelle d’un peuple qui naît à la liberté.</p>

</div>

<p>Again, a direct attack on the Girondins, especially in
the characteristic phrase, “the paralysis of honesty.”</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Le ministère de la marine enrayé longtemps dans les opérations par
une probité paralytique, et par des sous-ordres inexpérimentés ou suspects,
n’ayant donné ni protection au commerce, ni défense pour nos
côtes, ni moyens au succès de la course, ni activité aux grands armemens
dans nos ports, ni approvisionnemens suivis pour les flottes, reprend<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_408"></a>[408]</span>
sous un ministre nouveau son activité, nous promet une défense et une
marine....</p>

</div>

<p>Here again is a half-concession to the Girondins, which
was part of the policy I have spoken of in the text.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Le conseil exécutif en sent lui-même la nécessité: et nous lui devons
la justice de dire, que ne se dissimulant pas cette caducité politique,
amenée par les circonstances, par des dénonciations multipliées, et par
la presqu’impossibilité de tenir régulièrement le gouvernail au milieu
de la tempête; le conseil exécutif désire et sollicite le renouvellement
du ministère....</p>

<p class="center">DE L’ETAT MILITAIRE.</p>

<p>Pressés entre la nécessité de pourvoir sans délai aux besoins des
armées, et l’impossibilité d’approfondir en si peu de temps des plans
généraux, nous avons recherché d’abord des armes....</p>

<p>Des arrêtés du comité ont ordonné l’envoi des commissaires pour
dénombrer subitement les armes et les canons qui se trouvaient dans
les fabriques et les manufactures nationales, et pour les faire transporter
aux armées et dans les départemens les plus dénués de ce genre de
secours. Saint-Etienne, Ruel, Mont-Cénis, Indret, Toulouse, Lyon,
Charleville, Sedan, Maubeuge, ont reçu des ordres pressants sur cet
objet....</p>

<p>Divers arrêtés ont ordonné le transport de vieilles armes qui se
trouvent dans diverses fabriques ou arsenaux, pour les faire raccommoder
dans les diverses villes dont la population offrait des ouvriers, et surtout
dans les départemens limitrophes des pays révoltés....</p>

<p>Les ministres et les assemblées nationales ont mis trop peu d’importance
à la manufacture de Saint-Etienne, depuis le commencement
de la révolution.</p>

<p>Les ouvriers brûlaient du désir de travailler pour la république,
mais le prix de l’arme ayant toujours été fixé au-dessous des déboursés
du fabricant, ils ont travaillé pour les corps administratifs, dont la concurrence
a augmenté la valeur. Le fer et le salarie de l’ouvrier sont
augmentés de prix.</p>

<p>Des commissaires du pouvoir exécutif viennent de requérir tous les
fabricans de porter à la commission de verification, toutes les armes qui
sont en leur pouvoir, pour être expédies pour Bayonne, Perpignan, et
Tours. Les livraisons se font chaque jour.</p>

<p>Les commissaires s’occupent de redonner la plus grande activité à
la manufacture d’armes de Saint-Etienne, qui secondée par le patriotisme
des ouvriers et de la municipalité, portera la fabrication à quatre ou
cinq cents fusils ou pistolets par jour.</p>

<p>Il y a à Tulle un grand nombre d’armes à réparer, le comité en a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_409"></a>[409]</span>
fait distribuer à plusieurs départemens méridionaux; le ministre de la
marine donne de l’activité à la manufacture de Tulle, pour armer nos
marins. Dans ce moment, le commissaire Bouillet, envoyé par le conseil
exécutif, est a Tulle, pour accélérer la fabrication des armes nécessaires
à la marine, et pour connaître l’état des vieilles armes qu’on a
entassés dans ce dépôt....</p>

</div>

<p>The following passages indicate the motives of what
was to be the Terror, a system based, of course, upon the
necessity for commissariat.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">VIVRES.</p>

<p>Les vivres sont aussi nécessaires que les armes; on se plaint dans
quelques armées organisées trop lentement, ou improvisées trop à la
hâte, pour que tout ce qui leur était nécessaire fût préparé, et ces
plaintes sont justes; nous accélérons l’approvisionnement des armées,
autant qu’il est en nous, par le ministre et les administrations qui en
dépendent. La latitude des pouvoirs donnés à vos comités, peut suppléer
la faiblesse du ministère de la guerre l’insuffisance de ses agens,
et la malveillance ou la torpeur de ses régies. Il est cependant des
obstacles éprouvés par les régisseurs et par leurs agens, à cause des
craintes propagées sur le manque de subsistances, et le comité s’est
occupé de faire cesser ces obstacles.</p>

<p>L’administration chargée de l’approvisionnement des places de
guerre a présenté au comité des états de situation rassurante sur l’approvisionnement
des places les plus menacées: il lui a montré les
dispositions générales prises pour les fournitures de subsistances dans
toutes les divisions. Il en résulte que les évènemens imprévus de la
Belgique, en ramenant subitement l’ennemi sur nos frontières, ont
contrarié des calculs et nous ont privé des approvisionnements faits
d’après un autre système; mais le comité presse les directeurs de
pourvoir aux approvisionnements, et avertit sans cesse le ministre des
autres besoins des armées, à mesure que ces besoins se démontrent
ou que les plaintes nous parviennent. Un changement dans cette
administration, dont vous nous avez renvoyé l’examen, mérite toute
notre sollicitude, et se trouve être la suite inévitable des changements
perpétuels dans le ministère de la guerre; changement qui
entraîne celui de ses principes et de ses moyens.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">[165]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_410"></a>[410]</span></p>

<p>Le partie de l’habillement et de l’équipement, qui a coûté tant de
trésors à la nation, a été mal fournie, mal administrée, et pillée dans la
Belgique avec autant d’impudeur que de trahison.</p>

<p>Les fournisseurs, plus avares que patriotes, ont distribué à toutes les
armées des étoffes de mauvaise qualité. Un force de prodigalité nationale
payait les habits à l’avarice agioteuse qui les fournissait, et le soldat,
au milieu des fatigues et des perils de la guerre, était sans habits ou en
portait qui n’étaient pas de long usage.</p>

<p>Ces jours derniers il a défilé devant vous un détachement de braves
soldats du régiment ci-devant Conti, qui allait vers les départemens
révoltés. On n’aurait pas présenté au plus petit prince d’Allemagne,
ou au plus pauvre de l’Italie, des troupes aussi mal vêtues; elles ont
paru devant les représentans d’une nation qui dépense pour la guerre,
chaque mois, plus de millions que plusieurs rois de l’Europe n’ont de
revenu dans un an....</p>

<p>L’armée des Ardennes, réunie à celle du Nord, se forme sous les
regards de commissaires actifs, et les recrues y abondent à un point
que votre comité a cru devoir les faire refluer vers l’armee du Nord.</p>

</div>

<p>The next allusion is interesting as showing us the
appreciation of what was to be the reinforcement of the
army of Sambre-et-Meuse.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>L’armée de la Moselle a pris des positions avantageuses. Réunie à
celle du Rhin, elles annoncent que Mayence pourra devenir le tombeau
des hordes prussiennes. L’esprit est bon dans cette armée, distinguée
par la discipline, et les recrues s’y encadrent tous les jours.</p>

<p>On s’occupe à faire camper et exercer l’armée des Alpes, dont le
recrutement est entièrement effectué. On fortifie tous les points de
défense, et on augmente la garnison des places. Les recrues nombreuses
qui y sont arrivées ont fourni un excédant de vingt-un mille hommes;
vous avez disposé de huit mille contre les départemens révoltés. Les
treize mille restans renforceront l’armée d’Italie, diminuée pour servir
à la défense de la Corse, formeront une réserve ou renforceront l’armée
des Pyrénées orientales.</p>

<p>Le département du Mont-Blanc s’est empressé d’organiser plusieurs
bataillons et de prouver ainsi son attachement à la République; ils
réclament des armes, et nous espérons qu’avec des moyens mis déjà en
activité ils seront bientôt armés.</p>

<p>La révolte de Thonnes est appraisée et les coupables jugés. C’était
la mêche d’une mine préparée sous le Mont-Blanc, et dont l’explosion
était combinée avec la prochaine attaque des Piémontais et des
Autrichiens.</p>

<p>L’armée d’Italie se prépare à défendre ce que la valeur et la liberté
ont conquis à Nice. Mais des agitateurs y ont causé de la fermentation,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_411"></a>[411]</span>
comme dans l’armée des Alpes; ils y tenaient des propos injurieux à la
Convention nationale; ils y parlaient de royauté, et se servaient du
moyen de la paye en assignats pour altérer le bon esprit des troupes;
des alarmes ont été jetées sur les subsistances, dont le comité s’occupe
dans ce moment.</p>

<p>Le général de l’armée d’Italie a pris les moyens propres à découvrir
les agitateurs et à les faire conduire au tribunal extraordinaire.</p>

<p>L’armée des Pyrénées a été la plus négligé et la plus mal pourvue
en armes et en munitions, et c’est contre les troupes les plus féroces et
les plus fanatiques qu’elles doivent défendre les plus belles contrées de
la République.</p>

<p>Aussi nous sommes accablés tous les jours par des relations malheureuses
qui ne sont que le triste résultat de la négligence de deux
anciens ministres de la guerre qui n’ont jamais su penser qu’il existât
une armée des Pyrénées....</p>

</div>

<p>The whole of the above is an interesting example of the
detailed methods of the Committee, with its reiteration
against the Girondin management of the war. It continues
in much the same spirit.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Du côté de l’Océan, la trahison de quelque chef des Miquelets et la
lâcheté d’une partie du régiment vingtième ont livré un point de la
frontière. Une terreur panique produite par le mot de trahison et
par des malveillans semés dans les petits camps formés sur l’extrème
frontière, a désorganisé le peu de force qui y étaient arrivées, a découragé
ceux qui y accouraient et forcé d’abandonner Andaye et tout
le pays qui se trouve entre la rivière de Nivelle et la frontière pour ne
former qu’un seul camp à Bidarre.</p>

<p>La discipline à rétablir, le courage à relever, étaient les premiers
besoins de cette armée.</p>

<p>Nos commissaires se sont vus forcés d’établir provisoirement un
règlement sévère de discipline. Ils nous disent que l’ennemi abat
partout l’arbre de la liberté, fait les incursions sur les maisons des
patriotes dans la partie française abandonnée; mais les habitans des
campagnes ont le courage de ne pas obéir aux requisitions du général
espagnol.</p>

<p>Il paraît qu’il n’est fort que de notre faiblesse, et que si des secours
d’armes et d’artillerie sont portés a nos frères, notre territoire sera
bientôt évacué. Le commandement de Bayonne est confié au patriote
Courpon, et la citadelle de Saint-Esprit est défendue par des républicains.
Vingt canons et quatre compagnies des canonniers de Paris y
ont été envoyés en poste, et doivent avoir secouru cette frontière le 14
de ce mois; le camp de Bidarre se forme avec succès.</p>

<p>La division de l’armée des Pyrénées en deux grands parties, nous<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_412"></a>[412]</span>
donnera plus de force pour une défense active au besoin: la terre y
produit des bataillons d’hommes libres; nous leur devons des secours
abondans, car ils ont été oubliés jusqu’à présent. On eût dit, en voyant
l’état de ces frontières, que le complot était prêt, que la force devait
envahir le Nord, tandis que la perfidie et l’indéfense livreraient le Midi.
Mais l’intrépidité et l’enthousiasme des Méridionaux pour la liberté,
est un obstacle invincible au succès des négligences ministérielles, des
trahisons intérieures, et des succès que le perfide Pitt a promise à
l’Espagne. Le camp se forme devant Bayonne et il a repris du terrain
du côté d’Andaye; l’armée reprend l’attitude qui convient à des
phalanges républicaines, et l’artillerie commence à y arriver avec des
provisions.</p>

<p>L’affaire de la Vendée n’a été envisagée trop longtemps que comme
une affaire de police, ou une querelle élevée dans un coin d’un département.</p>

</div>

<p>There follows a further indictment based upon a special
case.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>L’armée des côtes n’a jamais existé; l’état-major n’avait pas même
été formé; quelques chefs militaires avaient été envoyés avec de faibles
moyens et de simples requisitions. On avait donné des ordres pour
que des cadres y fussent transportés; ils ont été arrêtés dans leur
marche par la crainte ou l’impuissance momentanée que nous avait
donné la trahison de Dumouriez. Des recrues y ont été rassemblées,
sans y trouver ni cadres, ni armes, ni un nombre suffisant d’officiers
généraux....</p>

<p>Voilà l’état où se trouvaient les armées au 10 mai, époque à laquelle
le comité a demandé inutilement la parole....</p>

</div>

<p>Then a summary, the detail of which is well worth
following.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">VOICI LE DERNIER ÉTAT.</p>

<p>Il arrive des troupes à Bayonne ainsi que des canons. Le camp qui
était à Bidard entre Bayonne et Saint-Jean de Luz a été porté, depuis
vendredi, entre Saint-Jean de Luz et Andaye.</p>

<p>L’armée des Pyrénées orientales qu’on espérait, au moyen des recrutemens,
mettre en état de contenir au moins l’Espagnol, a essuyé presque
consécutivement deux échecs qui compromettent la sûreté de cette
partie de la frontière. Cette défaite n’est due qu’à la gendarmerie
nationale; mais un exemple prompt et sévère mettra un terme à cette
lâcheté ou à cette trahison.</p>

<p>Aux Alpes nous venons d’être menacés d’une attaque très prochaine
exécutée par des forces très considérables, surtout dans la partie du<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_413"></a>[413]</span>
Var, débouché par lequel l’ennemi peut menacer aussi Marseille et
Toulon. Le comité de salut public a dû prendre la seule mesure qui
était en son pouvoir; il a ordonné au général Kellerman, le seul qui
eût une connaissance suffisante des points de défense et de nos moyens
militaires dans cette partie, de s’y rendre avec la plus grande diligence,
afin de prévenir, s’il est possible, les malheurs que le moindre retard
pourrait amener. Le général de l’armée d’Italie a paru craindre que la
cour de Naples ne vienne renforcer la coalition dans le midi. Mais le
ministre des affaires étrangères vient de communiquer des dépêches qui
détruisent ces nouvelles.</p>

<p>Kellerman s’est fait précéder par un courrier extraordinaire qui a
porté à ses lieutenans les ordres préparatoires des opérations auxquelles
l’ennemi peut le forcer. Ce général, investi de votre confiance et de
celle des troupes, ne pouvait être remplacé. On vous avait annoncé
d’abord qu’il se rendrait dans la Vendée; mais les avantages remportés
un instant sur les révoltés, et la certitude de la prochaine arrivée de
Biron dans les départemens révoltés, ont du faire changer la première
destination de Kellerman. L’armée d’Italie a des subsistences assurées
pour quelque temps. On a pris des mesures pour la mettre à l’abri de
la disette.</p>

<p>Au Rhin, une action qui n’a servi qu’à la destruction des hommes,
sans avancer les affaires d’aucun parti, y laisse les choses à peu près
dans la même situation qu’auparavant, avec cette différence, que le
changement de général qui a été en partie forcé, peut influer sur nos
succès. Il est bon d’observer que nos armées dans cette partie se trouvent
avoir en tête des forces les plus manœuvrières, et commandées par
les généraux les plus accrédités de l’Europe.</p>

<p>Nos généraux, au contraire, portés au commandement pour la
première fois, ne peuvent avoir la même habitude et les mêmes avantages
que ceux auxquels les grands mouvemens de guerre sont familiers.
Les approvisionnemens dans cette partie et les subsistances sont bien
assurés.</p>

<p>Dans le Nord, notre situation est très alarmante, et la Convention
doit connaître tous ces maux; elle a besoin d’être instruite par le malheur,
et de sentir les tristes effets de ses divisions.</p>

<p>Notre armée, repoussée entre Combrai et Bouchain, quittant son
camp de Famars pour prendre plus loin celui de Coefar, abandonnant
à leurs propres forces Condé et Valenciennes, perdant ses communications
avec Douay et Lille d’un côté, et de l’autre avec Maubeuge et le
Quesnoy, est exposée à de nouveaux revers, si la présence du général
Custine, qui a dû y arriver le 25, ne lui rend pas la discipline qui lui
manque et la confiance sans laquelle il n’est point de succès à obtenir
dans la guerre.</p>

<p>Si les efforts de ce général ne sont pas promptement secondés par
l’union des représentans du peuple, la Convention doit s’attendre à<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_414"></a>[414]</span>
tomber dans une situation plus embarrassante qu’au moment où, pendant
la dernière campagne, les esclaves allemands entraient en Champagne,
et menaçaient Paris et la liberté. Alors d’heureux hasards, ou
plutôt cette destinée qui semble conduire la France, ont disparaître des
dangers aussi imminens; mais doit-on compter sur une nouvelle faveur
de l’aveugle fortune? ne devons-nous pas craindre une nouvelle invasion,
et pouvons-nous nous flatter que toutes nos villes imiteront le
généreux dévouement de celle de Maubeuge, qui nous écrit le 26 de ce
mois:—“Ici on bat la générale dans cet instant: on a envoyé une
partie de notre garnison dans la Vendée; nous restons; nous déjouerons
nos ennemis extérieurs et intérieurs, ou nous mourrons libres. La ville
sautera si nos murs abattus permettent à l’ennemi de souiller notre
enceinte.”</p>

<p>Quant aux besoins de cette armée du Nord, peut-être croira-t-on
difficilement que, malgré toutes nos dépenses, la demande qui vient
d’être faite au comité, qui a été arrêtée par le commissaire général de
l’armée du Nord, et visée par les commissaires de la Convention, monte
à la somme de 49 millions.</p>

<p>L’armée qui doit anéantir les révoltés s’organise; il arrive un grand
nombre de bataillons à Tours; les postes de la rive droite de la Loire
se renforcent, et l’on fait défiler des troupes en poste. Si les rebelles
menacent cette rive, ils sont hors d’état d’exécuter ce project; leurs
forces ce divisent, mais ils rentrent dans les pays couverts. Les principaux
chefs des révoltés sont subordonnés aux prêtres; c’est une véritable
croisade; mais les habitans des campagnes commencent à se lasser
de cette horrible guerre, et murmurent.</p>

<p>D’un autre côté, on nous écrit qu’il est parti, depuis notre dernier
succès, un courier de Bruxelles à Londres, pour engager le cabinet de
Saint-James à accélérer un armament tendant à porter sur les côtes de
Bretagne des troupes, des armes, des munitions, et à vomir sur nos
rivages un corps considérable d’émigrés de Jersey et Guernsey.</p>

<p>Le transfuge Condé a envoyé à Jersey tous les émigrés bretons pour
être déposés sur nos côtes et y seconder un des rejetons de la famille de
nos tyrans.</p>

<p>On se plaignait presque partout des commissaires des guerres ce
corps essentiel des armées va être changé, amélioré sur de nouvelles
bases et épuré par des choix patriotiques.</p>

<p>Quant à la suppression de la paie en numéraire, toutes les armées
de la République l’ont reçue sans peine; ils sacrifient à chaque instant
leur vie à la liberté, comment s’occuperaient-il d’intérêts pécuniaires?
mais aussi ils ont droit à plus de surveillance pour les approvisionemens
et pour les subsistances. Quelques compagnies de l’armée d’Italie
seulement ont montré de la résistance; mais les agitateurs seront
déjoués par la surveillance qui y a été établie, et par les soins de vos
commissaires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_415"></a>[415]</span></p>

<p>Dans le choix des officiers généraux, nous avons dû quelquefois
obéir aux défiances populaires et aux dénonciations individuelles;
mais c’est là un des maux attachés à la révolution, qui use beaucoup
d’hommes, qui en éloigne un plus grand nombre, et qui présente plus
d’accusations que de ressources. Sans doute après les odieuses trahisons
qui ont affligé et qui affligent encore la république et désorganisé deux
fois les armées, on peut, on doit même devenir défiant et soupçonneux;
mais la ligne qui sépare la défiance et la calomnie, est trop facile à dépasser;
et si la dénonciation juste est une action civique, l’accusation
intéressée est la honte de nos mœurs et la ressource de la haine....</p>

<p>Le comité, pour ne rien négliger dans cette terrible partie de la
guerre, a interrogé des militaires instruits; il s’est environné de leur
expérience pour faire un plan de guerre auquel se rattacheraient des
plans de campagne pour chacune des armées. Jusqu’à présent la
guerre de la liberté a été faite sans plans, sans suite, sans prévoyance
même; il est plus que temps de tracer les limites dans lesquelles la
guerre sera soutenue, dans quelle partie elle sera défensive, dans quelle
autre elle sera offensive, assigner à chaque armée la portion de frontières
qu’elle a à défendre, les points des ennemis qu’elle doit attaquer ou
couvrir.</p>

</div>

<p>In what follows regarding the Navy, we see the attempt
of the Committee, which we know was foredoomed to
failure, but which was a fine one, to meet the English
Power. The “error,” as English critics have called it, of
rapidly putting in new officers was an unfortunate necessity.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">DE LA MARINE.</p>

<p>Ici nous devons accuser ce système perfide de Bertrand et de ses
semblables, qui, depuis plusieurs années, semblait préparer, de concert
avec l’Angleterre, l’abaissement de la France, et assurer à nos plus
constans ennemis l’empire des mers.... C’est par la réunion des forces
navales, que nos ennemis out espéré d’attaquer plus sûrement notre
indépendance, et de nous dicter de lois. Quoique par cette coalition
l’on ait tenté aveuglement de faire passer la balance du pouvoir à une
nation maritime, déjà trop puissante pour l’intérêt du continent; ...
quoique, par la désorganisation passagère de notre marine, par le
dénuement de nos ports, par le ralentissement des travaux, on ait
espéré de changer la destinée de la république française, ne craignons
pas que l’on parvienne à faire rétrograder la plus belle des révolutions.</p>

<p>La surveillance constante du comité, le zèle du ministre, et le
dévouement de l’armée navale qui se forme, feront oublier tant de
trahisons ou de négligences, mais les moyens ne peuvent être que lents.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_416"></a>[416]</span></p>

<p>Des expéditions hardies, et confiées à des hommes courageux sont
préparées; les plaintes du commerce ont été enfin entendues d’après
le dernier rapport du ministre, le cabotage va être protégé dans l’Océan
par 34 canonnières, 12 corvettes, 18 lougres, cutters ou avisos, et dans
la Méditerranée, par 18 corvettes, ou cannonières et 5 avisos, indépendamment
des frégates dont il est inutile de faire connaître le
nombre et les stations, sans trahir les intérêts de la défense de la
république....</p>

<p>Il existe beaucoup d’officiers capables; l’abaissement des vains préjugés
qui séparaient l’armée commerciale de l’armée navale, nous assure
des ressources, mais il faut les surveiller et punir sévèrement la désobéissance
ou la malversation; avant de choisir les officiers, examen et
impartialité; après le choix, confiance entière, mais responsabilité impérieuse.
Le secret accompagnera nos opérations, si les inquiétudes du
commerçant ou les soupçons du zèle patriotique ne viennent pas les
altérer ou les contrarier; les corps civils ne doivent pas s’immiscer dans
le secret des opérations navales, ou bien nos ennemis le sauront bientôt,
et nous vaincrons sans nous laisser sortir de nos ports.</p>

<p>Le comité s’occupe des lois répressives que la discipline navale
réclame avec plus d’intérêt que jamais. Une grande force s’organise
dans les ports de la Méditerranée, qui par notre position, doit être le
canal de navigation du commerce français....</p>

<p>On s’occupe des moyens les plus propres à retirer les colonies de
l’état malheureux où elles se trouvent, depuis qu’une cour perfide
voulait faire la contre-révolution en France, par les malheurs de
l’Amérique; et si, à côté de nous, des Français veulent se rappeler
qu’ils descendant de Guillaume, tous les calculs de la politique insulaire
pourront être dérangés.</p>

<p>Le comité ne peut vous offrir aucun résultat précis et détaillé dans
ce moment; il serait même impolitique de la publier. Mais tout se
prépare, et quoique les forces de la république soient très inférieures à
celles des ennemis coalisés, le patriotisme les dirigera de manière à
rappeler le courage des filibustiers, et les exploits des Bart et des Dugay-Trouin....</p>

</div>

<p>In foreign affairs we have the Dantonesque idea of
pitting the Powers against one another, which, unfortunately
for France, fanatics who were in power later abandoned.
The remark on the impolitic nature of the decree
of the 19th of December should be specially noted: it
comes direct from Danton.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_417"></a>[417]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">DES AFFAIRES ÉTRANGÈRES.</p>

<p>... Le ministère anglais est forcé, malgré son influence et son
orgueil avare, de voir Dantzick passer au pouvoir de la Prusse, sans
réclamation; de voir la Pologne, se partager sans sa participation; et
de se compromettre vis-à-vis la morale et l’esprit public de la nation
anglaise. Aussi l’intrigant Pitt, qui ne peut se dissimuler que le ministre
qui fait la guerre, traite rarement de la paix, surtout chez une nation
éclairée et trompée sur cette guerre par l’astuce profonde de son gouvernement,
ne cesse d’invoquer sans cesse auprès de la ligne, la cause
générale des cours....</p>

<p>Le comité a cherché à resserrer le lien qui attache déjà, par les relations
commerciales, le peuple suisse et le peuple français; et l’ambassadeur que
la Suisse a reçu suit constamment le vœu témoigné par la Convention
nationale, de s’allier avec les gouvernemens justes et les peuples libres.</p>

<p>Nous apprenons que les peuples neutres et amis reçoivent avec
reconnaissance le décret du 15 avril, qui eut servi plus utilement la liberté,
s’il eut été d’une date plus reculée, et si le décret impolitique du 19
décembre n’eût pas donné un nouveau prétexte à la perfidie des cours
étrangères.</p>

<p>Ce décret par lequel vous aviez déclaré que la France ne souffrirait
jamais qu’aucune puissance semélât de sa constitution et de son gouvernement,
et qu’à son tour, elle ne s’immiscerait en rien sur les autres
gouvernemens; ce décret a augmenté subitement le nombre de nos
partisans dans la Suisse; et le témoignage d’un peuple simple et libre
a son prix auprès des républicains.</p>

<p>Des négociations d’alliance ne sont plus des chimères pour la France
libre. Il est des puissances qui ont senti que l’élévation ou la ruine
d’une nation intéressent toutes les autres et que celles même qui sont
le plus éloignées du théâtre de la guerre, sont souvent les victimes
de leur modération ou de leur indifférence. Il est des alliés pour
leur propre sûreté, peuvent soutenir nos intérêts, avec autant de
chaleur que de bonne foi. Il est d’autres alliances que la politique
doit vous assurer, et d’autres qui seront dues en grande partie à votre
état républicain; votre commerce ne peut que s’en féliciter.</p>

<p>L’Italie voit avec intérêt le signe de la République arboré dans ses
villes, si j’excepte les villes gouvernées encore par un prêtre et par la
maison d’Autriche....</p>

<p>Nous apprenons que la Russie a fait faire à la Porte la demande
officielle du passage d’une flotte, menaçant de regarder le refus qu’on
pourrait lui en faire comme une déclaration de guerre. La réponse a
été dilatoire et sera négative; les usurpations de la Russie trouveront
enfin des bornes. C’est à la politique européenne à aider le maître des
Dardanelles à les poser....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_418"></a>[418]</span></p>

<p>Une suite de coalisation faite contre la France, avait jeté des obstacles
à l’arrivée des chebecs à Alger. On voulait encore vous aliéner cette
puissance, amie de la République; mais nous recevons la nouvelle que le
dey a reçu, avec le plus vif intérêt, les deux chebecs que la République
lui a renvoyés, et qu’il a témoigné les dispositions les plus favorables à
la France....</p>

</div>

<p>There follows the French criticism of the Alien Bill.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Un bill infâme, qui insulte à l’humanité et aux droits des nations,
a été promulgué par le gouvernement anglais, et traduit en espagnol à
Madrid et dans les villes hanséatiques, par les intrigues de l’ambassadeur
anglais. Ce bill, dont la haine pour la convention a dicté les clauses
horribles contre les Français, vous portera sans doute à user du droit de
représailles. Le comité vous fera un rapport sur cet objet, ainsi que
sur les diverses mesures à prendre contre la gouvernement anglais.
Des agens nombreux sont disséminés dans l’Europe, pour connaître les
complots de nos ennemis au dedans et au dehors, et pour s’assurer des
véritables amis de la république.</p>

<p>Il résulte enfin, de toutes nos relations, que Dumouriez et ses aides-de-camp,
chassés du Stoutgard, n’ont pas reçu un meilleur accueil à
Vursbourg, par ordre de l’électeur, quoique évêque. Ainsi, les traîtres
ne trouvent pas d’asyle même chez les despotes à qui ils se sacrifient.</p>

</div>

<p>Matters concerning the Interior are comparatively vague,
for here the Committee wished to compromise with the
Gironde; but they are strong against civil war.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">DE L’INTÉRIEUR.</p>

<p>... Quant aux approvisionnemens des armées et de la marine, les
commissaires éprouvent des obstacles, en ne pouvant, d’après le dernier
décret, acheter que dans les marchés.</p>

<p>Le comité s’est occupé ensuite de sonder la plaie et de connaître la
source de toutes les agitations qui tourmentent la république.</p>

<p>Ici des vérités doivent nous être déclarées; car, vous êtes sur le
bord d’un abyme profond, et la Convention Nationale, au milieu de ses
divisions, a oublié qu’elle marchait entre deux écueils, et qu’elle était
conduite par l’aveugle anarchie.</p>

<p>D’un côté, l’exécrable plan de la guerre civile, secondé par l’Anglais,
et sans doute dirigée de Londres, de Rome et par des agens correspondans
à Paris, étendait ses ramifications sur toute la France, et principalement
dans les pays qui étaient, depuis la révolution, infestés de fanatisme,
ou qui avaient été le théâtre des troubles fanatiques et des complots
contre-révolutionnaires.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_419"></a>[419]</span></p>

<p>D’un autre côté, une alarme générale s’est répandue parmi les propriétaires
d’un territoire de vingt-sept mil de lieues quarrées, et ces
craintes ont eu pour base des motions exagérées, des journaux feuillantisés
et des propos sauguinaires; le mécontentement né de nos
discussions personnelles a altéré la confiance, mais vous êtes nécessaires:
les aristocrates, redoutant les passions des patriotes, ont excité
les hommes énergiques contre les modérés auxquels ils se rattachent
sourdement; ils ont préparé des mouvemens contraires....</p>

<p>Marseille, Bordeaux, Lyon, Rouen, prenez garde, la liberté vous
observe sur votre marche dans la révolution; elle ne vous croira jamais
contraire à ses vues; mais craignez d’être stationnaires dans le mouvement
de l’opinion publique; écrasez avec nous les révoltés, les anarchistes
et les brigands; mais aussi craignez le modérantisme et les
intrigues de l’aristocratie qui veut vous effrayer sur les propriétés et sur
le commerce, pour vous redonner des nobles, des prêtres et un roi....</p>

<p>Au moment où le comité a été formé, presque partout les administrations
trop faibles ou trop au dessous des circonstances se ressentaient
de l’influence meurtrière des passions particulières qui y correspondaient...</p>

<p>A Lyon, l’aristocratie a un foyer plus profond qu’on ne peut le
penser; elle est secondée par l’égoïsme et l’indifférence....</p>

<p>Mais les campagnes et les villes de department de Rhône et Loire,
surtout Villefranche, présente un autre esprit, et là surtout paraissent
ces signes heureux, là sont entendues ces acclamations énergiques qui
caractérisent le patriotisme.</p>

<p>A Marseille où tout annonce l’ardeur républicaine, à Marseille où
l’on voit presque à chaque pas un arbre de la liberté ou une inscription
civique, à Marseille où le pain, égal pour tout et de mauvaise qualité,
se vend sept sols la livre, cette calamité est supportée sans murmurer,
où l’on entend des plaintes contre les traîtres, les égoïstes, les intrigans;
où les seuls malheurs dont on soit afflige sont ceux qui frappent la
République entière, Marseille a éprouvé des convulsions violentes; mais
si la répression de quelques excès de la démagogie a fait craindre à de
bons citoyens que le modérantisme ne prévalût, le républicanisme n’en
triomphera pas moins des passions individuelles. Croyons que cette
grande cité ne dégénérera pas de sa renommée.</p>

<p>Nous avons à gémir sur des excès commis à Avignon et à Aix; ce
qui s’est passé d’irrégulier à Toulon, relativement aux officiers de la
marine, vous sera rapporté quand le comité aura fait le travail de cette
partie.</p>

<p>Le meilleur esprit règne dans ce moment à Perpignan; la vieille
antipathie nationale contre l’Espagnol, y réchauffé l’esprit républicain
que le département des Pyrénées orientales avait déjà montré avec tant
d’énergie le 21 Juin 1791.</p>

<p>Bayonne se rattache aux bons principes. Les trahisons lui ont donné<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_420"></a>[420]</span>
de l’énergie; mais si cette place est dans ce moment menacée de près
par l’ennemi, le zèle des républicains méridionaux la défendra contre
les ennemis du dedans et du dehors.</p>

<p>Bordeaux ne cesse de fournir à la liberté et a ses armées des trésors
et des soldats; elle va défendre en même temps les Pyrénées et les
Deux-Sèvres.</p>

<p>Les intentions manifestées à Nantes ne se ressentent pas assez de
l’enthousiasme civique qui doit animer dans ce moment tous les citoyens.
Ses moyens auraient pu être plus efficaces; il y a du mécontentement
et des craintes sur les effets des divisions intestines.</p>

<p>A Orléans, l’esprit public s’améliore, depuis que l’aristocratie a été
frappée par la loi révolutionnaire; mais cette ville a le droit d’obtenir
que les procédures faites par les commissaires soient bientôt jugées, les
coupables punis et les bons citoyens rassurés.</p>

<p>Dans le département de l’Allier, une correspondance interceptée a
fait découvrir des traînes contre la liberté, elles étaient ourdies par des
prêtres déportés, de concert avec leurs agens à Moulins. Les corps administratifs,
qui vivent dans la plus heureuse harmonie, ont mis en lieu
de sûreté les ci-devant que leur conduite avait rendus suspects et les y
font garder avec soin et humanité, jusqu’à ce que la République n’ait plus
rien à craindre de ses ennemis intérieurs et de ces enfans dénaturés. Le
peuple a partout applaudi à cette énergie de ses magistrats, et il les a
secourus, parce que le peuple veut franchement la liberté.</p>

<p>A Roanne, le modérantisme est réduit en système, et dans la crise
où nous sommes, cette apathie politique est le plus grand fléau de la
République, qui ne peut s’établir que par le développement de toute
l’énergie nationale.</p>

<p>A Tain, dans le département de la Drôme, des patriotes, que
n’étaient qu’aisés dans leur fortune (le patriotisme se trouve rarement
avec la fortune), se sont cotisés, et, de concert avec le Maire, ont fait,
sans y être contraints par la loi, mais par amour pour la patrie, une
cotisation, dont le produit a été employé à fournir du pain à un prix
modéré, pour les citoyens peu fortunés. C’est ainsi que dans les provinces
méridionales, les mœurs et l’humanité font plus que les lois et le
cœur des riches dans les grandes cités....</p>

<p>A Tours, l’administration d’Indre et Loire, apprenant que les ennemis
étaient à Loudun, et marchaient à Chinon, a pris la résolution, par un
mouvement civique et spontané, de se transporter toute entière au
milieu des dangers qui les menaçaient, et décidée à s’ensevelir sous les
ruines de la ville, plutôt que de se rendre. Une commission y est restée.
Loudun a demeuré sans défense. Quelques aristocrates en ont été
heureusement chassés.</p>

<p>Poitiers, trop influencé par des fanatiques et par des hommes de
l’ancien régime, peut donner des espérances aux révoltés, et déjà l’administration
nous a fait craindre le résultat du mauvais esprit d’une<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_421"></a>[421]</span>
partie de ses habitans, malgré l’énergie connue des patriotes qu’elle
renferme.</p>

<p>Paris qu’on accuse sans cesse, qu’on agite presque toujours, tantôt
par des crimes, tantôt par des intrigues, tantôt par des passions personnelles,
tantôt par des intérêts secrets et étrangers, et plus souvent encore
par l’action prolongée ou l’exaltation des passions révolutionnaires;
Paris, réceptacle de tant d’étrangers, de tant de conspirateurs, doit
attirer vos regards.</p>

</div>

<p>The following passage on the Commune of Paris is
noteworthy for its non-committal character, in keeping with
the attempt to get rid of the Gironde, if possible, without
an insurrection.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Vous devez contenir le conseil général de la commune de Paris dans
les limites que l’unité et l’indivisibilité de la République exigent et que
la loi lui prescrit. C’est à vous qu’il appartient seul de dominer toutes
les ambitions politiques, de détruire toutes les usurpations législatives;
c’est à vous de répondre à la France du dépôt de pouvoir qui vous a été
religieusement confié.</p>

<p>Vous devez aviser aux movemens inégaux et anarchiques que des
intrigans font passer dans plusieurs sections peuplées de bons citoyens,
et aux mouvemens aristocratiques qu’on pourrait cependant leur communiquer.</p>

<p>Vous devez surveiller également le moderantisme qui paralyse tout
et prépare la perte de la liberté, et les excès le la démagogie dont les
émigrés et les ambitieux, déguisés parmi nous, tiennent le secret et le
prix journalier.</p>

<p>L’esprit des habitans de Paris est bon, malgré les vices de l’égoïsme,
de l’avarice et de l’apathie d’un certain nombre de ses habitans. L’amour
de la liberté, qu’on a voulu tant de fois y neutraliser, sort victorieux de
toutes les épreuves; et nous pensons que Paris n’appartiendra jamais
qu’à la liberté; Paris qui à détruit le trône, ne souffrira pas qu’aucune
autorité usurpe le pouvoir national, qui est la propriété de tous, et qui
est le véritable lieu de tous les départemens.</p>

<p>Malgré toutes les intrigues par lesquelles on a cherché à empêcher
Paris de prononcer son patriotisme en marchant contre les révoltés,
chaque section a fourni ou s’occupe de fournir son contingent pour former
douze ou quatorze bataillons de mille hommes....</p>

</div>

<p>I quote certain portions which show the fear of the
Committee, so often justified, with regard to foreign intrigue.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_422"></a>[422]</span></p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">FINANCES.</p>

<p>Il a agioté le numéraire pour avilir l’assignat; il a fait hausser les
changes, par ses opérations à la bourse.</p>

<p class="center">DISSENTIONS CIVILES.</p>

<p>Il a alimenté le fanatisme de la Vendée; il a fourni des hommes,
des armes et des munitions.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">[166]</a></p>

<p class="center">ROYALISME.</p>

<p>C’est l’anglais, qui a combiné les regrets et ravivé les espérances,
par l’excès du républicanisme qu’il a fomenté, par les motions des lois
agraires, dont il cherchait ensuite à faire imputer les projets à des
patriotes connus....</p>

<p class="center">GÉNÉRAUX.</p>

<p>Celui qui avait acheté Arnold en Amérique, a acheté Dumouriez en
Europe, et il a dû traiter de même les militaires qui n’aiment pas la
république....</p>

<p class="center">DE L’ORGANISATION SOCIALE.</p>

<p>L’anglais a semé l’effroi dans l’âme des propriétaires par des motions
sur les partages des terres, et dans le cœur des commerçans par le pillage
des magasins....</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_423"></a>[423]</span></p>

<p>L’anglais a imaginé de la bloquer, de l’affamer, de l’incendier dans
ses ports, dans ses édifices publics; de détruire son industrie; il armé
tour à tour l’aristocrate contre le patriote, et le patriote contre l’aristocrate;
enfin, le peuple contre le peuple, espérant que le spectacle de
nos troubles ôtera au peuple anglais le courage de détruire chez
lui le despotisme royal.</p>

<p class="center">PERTE DE PARIS.</p>

<p>C’est au cœur que les assassins frappent; c’est sur les capitales que
les conquérans dirigent leurs coups. On ne pouvait perdre Paris par
les armés; on a voulu perdre Paris par les départemens; on y a semé
dès terreurs pour le ruiner par la fuite des propriétaires et des riches;
on a semé des idées de suprématie, pour séparer, pour isoler les départemens
de Paris.</p>

</div>

<p>The danger of civil war and vigorous methods for
meeting it are the subject of the passages that follow.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">DIVISION DU TERRITOIRE.</p>

<p>L’anglais enfin a espéré diviser la France pour la morceler ou la
ruiner. Dans son délire, il a espéré de voir une monarchie impuissante
s’établir dans le nord, et des républiques misérables et divisées se former
dans le midi.</p>

<p>J’ai dévoilé le gouvernement britannique; il n’est plus à craindre.</p>

<p>Dans un très grand nombre de départemens on a procédé à la
réclusion des personnes notoirement suspectes d’incivisme et soupçonnées
d’entretenir des intelligences avec les émigrés et les contre-révolutionnaires.
On en accuse généralement les prêtres et les moines,
les émigrés rentrés impunément sur notre territoire, et les correspondants
qui les soutenaient de leurs fortunes et de leurs espérances.</p>

<p>On a dû prendre des mesures sévères, alors que tous les aristocrates
correspondaient à la Vendée, et que des lettres interceptées annonçaient
un rassemblement à Nantes.</p>

<p>Des arrestations nombreuses ont dû être la suite de ces méfiances,
de ces trahisons disséminées dans toute la France; l’autorité, dans les
temps de révolution, a plus d’yeux et de bras que d’entrailles; mais le
législateur doit à tous les citoyens cette justice exacte qui vient régulariser
les premiers mouvemens et faire statuer sur la liberté individuelle
avec les précautions que les circonstances peuvent admettre.
Vous devez abattre également toutes les aristocraties et toutes les
tyrannies; vous devez approuver vos commissaires s’ils ont bien fait,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_424"></a>[424]</span>
les blâmer et les punir s’ils ont violé les droits des citoyens. Le comité
pense que le comité de législation et de sûreté générale doivent proposer
incessamment une loi qui règle le mode de jugement de la
légitimité de ces arrestations, et qui renvoie aux tribunaux les
coupables ou laissât en réclusion ceux qui ne sont que notoirement
suspects.</p>

<p>Le département de l’Ain voit l’esprit public se rétablir parmises
habitans.</p>

<p>La conspiration qui a éclaté dans l’Ouest semblait se montrer dans
les départemens de l’Ardèche, du Gard, de la Haute Loire et du Cantal;
mais les administrateurs et vos commissaires sont parvenus à les réprimer.
Ces troubles de la Lozère ont un caractère plus fort; mais le
patriotisme de ce département et de ses voisins y mettra bientôt un
terme.</p>

<p>Les tribunaux ont sévi contre les coupables; nous avions craint que
vos commissaires n’eussent dépassé leurs pouvoirs dans le département
de l’Ardèche, et nous les aurions déféré à votre sévère justice pour
donner l’exemple de la punition de ceux qu’on affecte d’appeler des
proconsuls, pour empêcher le bien qu’ils peuvent faire ou en empoisonner
les résultats; mais un décret avait déjà mis hors de la loi
les coupables complices de Defaillant.</p>

<p>La trahison de Dumouriez que tout annonce avoir eu des branches
très étendus, a été un trait de lumière; elle a frappé es administrations
et les citoyens d’un coup électrique. Tous nos moyens ont
centuplé par cet évènement destiné à les paralyser; mais de tous les
maux préparés insensiblement dans les départemens frontières comme
dans le centre, comme au milieu de nous le plus grand, le plus effrayant
par ses progrès, est la marche imprévue des contre-révolutionnaires
nobiliares, sacerdotaux et émigrés qui, du fond de la Vendée et du
Morbihan remontent la Loire, menacent nos cités de l’intérieur, et
emploient à la fois, des moyens de terreur et de persuasion....</p>

<p>Les révoltés ont plusieurs corps de rassemblement. Le principe
qui s’était porté a Thouars, était, suivant les uns, de quinze mille
suivant la dernière relation envoyée par un de nos commissaires, il
était de vingt à vingt-cinq mille hommes armés, partie de piques,
partie de fusils; ils traînent avec eux, treize pièces de canon, selon
les uns, et d’après le dernier succès de Thouars, trente pièces
d’artillerie.</p>

<p>Ils sont commandés par des ci-devant nobles et accompagnés par
des prêtres; toutes leurs femmes leur servent d’espions; ils se battent
pour des fiefs et des prières. Les agriculteurs fanatiques combattent
avec fureur et ne pillent pas; ils composent la moitié de la troupe.</p>

<p>Un quart est composé de gardes-chasses, d’échappés des galères et
de faux sauniers. Ils pillent, dévastent, égorgent, et sont bien dignes
de leurs chefs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_425"></a>[425]</span></p>

<p>L’autre quart est formé d’hommes pusillanimes ou indifférens,
que la violence force de marcher, mais qui, à la première défaite des
brigands, se retireraient, et forment, pour ainsi dire, la propriété du
premier occupant. C’est à la liberté de s’en emparer par des succès.</p>

<p>Il n’y a que les émigrés, les ci-devant, et les prêtres qui voudraient
mettre de l’ordre dans les rassemblemens, et de la tactique dans cette
guerre. Ils paient, les rebelles deux tiers en numéraire.</p>

<p>Les chefs connus sont les ci-devant de Leseur, Laroche-Jacquelin,
Beauchamp, Langrenière, Delbecq, Baudré-de-Brochin, Debouillé-Loret,
un abbé appelé Larivière. Domengé est colonel-général de la cavalerie;
Demenens et Delbecq commandent l’armée catholique-royale.</p>

<p>Le comité a pourvu journellement par des arrêtés pressans, à ce que
cette guerre intestine fût efficacement comprimée....</p>

<p>Déjà l’armée s’organise à Tours; une commission centrale est
établie à Saumur; déjà des troupes de ligne ont dépassé Paris pour s’y
rendre, et le renfort considérable que le comité avait requis, est en
route pour s’y rendre. Les voitures des riches, les équipages du luxe,
auront du moins servi une fois à la défense de la patrie et de la liberté.
Une armée est dirigée en poste sur les rives de la Loire. C’est ainsi
qu’un des plus fameux guerrieurs du nord alla écraser en 1757 les
autrichiens à la bataille de Liffa ou Leuten, avec une armée arrivée en
poste sur le champ de bataille....</p>

<p>Le comité prépare un rapport sur les agens périodiques de l’opinion
publique, et sur les arrêtés violateurs de la liberté de la presse.</p>

<p>Tel est le tableau de l’intérieur de la république, d’après les
rapports et la correspondance des commissaires et des corps administratifs.
Nous devons le terminer par une réflexion sur les commissaires,
dont on cherche trop à effrayer les citoyens, et même plusieurs
membres de la convention....</p>

</div>

<p>The influence of Cambon is apparent in what follows.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">DES CONTRIBUTIONS PUBLIQUES.</p>

<p>Quant aux contributions, rien ne prouve mieux le désir de voir
fonder la République, et de voir renaître l’ordre social le paiement des
impositions, au milieu des ruines et de débris de l’ancien gouvernement;
s’il y a de l’arriéré, ce n’est que par les fautes des administrations qui
n’ont pas encore terminé la confection des rôles; quelques-unes ont
arrêté tout envoi de fonds. Mais un moyen de salut public, appartient
à cette partie de l’administration, c’est de vous occuper sans relâche,
des lois concernant les contributions publiques, de l’accélération de la
vente des biens d’émigrés, et des maisons ci-devant royales, objets qui
semblent encore attendre leurs anciens et coupables possesseurs; et
des moyens de retirer de la circulation, une certaine masse d’assignats.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_426"></a>[426]</span>
Vous devez cette loi au peuple, qui a vu s’augmenter par une progression
effrayante et ruineuse, le prix des subsistances; vous le devez
à tous les créanciers de la République et à tous ceux qu’elle salarie,
afin de rétablir la balance rompu trop rapidement, par la masse énorme
de cette monnaie. La portion du peuple qui mérite avant toutes les
autres l’attention de ses représentants, est celle qui souffre tous les
jours au surhaussement du prix des denrées.</p>

<p>Les contributions indirectes, perçues au milieu des mouvemens de
la révolution, et des défiances semées sur son succès, par des mécontens
et des ennemis publics, alimentent abondamment le trésor national.
Déjà dans les trois derniers mois de Janvier, Février et Mars, la perception
des impôts indirects excède de plusieurs millions l’estimation
qui en a été faite. Le total des trois mois, se porte a 52,182,468 livres
en y comprenant 5,400,000 livres, de l’adjudication des bois. Que
serace dans un temps de paix et de prospérité? Quelle confiance la
République doit avoir de ses forces et de ses moyens?</p>

<p>Nous avons vu avec regret, parmi les produits de l’imposition
indirecte, des droits qui devraient être inconnus à des peuples libres,
des droits de bâtardise et de déshérence, et que les sauvages de
l’Amérique repousseraient.</p>

</div>

<p>From henceforward Danton’s hand is apparent throughout
the report. Some matters on the Constitution and on
Public Construction, which have little to do with the insurrection
of June 2nd, have been omitted, but the Dantonian
policy of framing a constitution which should reconcile
enemies is printed in full.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p class="center">DES COLONIES.</p>

<p>Nous ne disons encore rien des colonies, quoique nous ayons reçu
des mémoires et des vues sur cet objet important et malheureux,
d’où dépend la prospérité publique, et l’agrandissement de la marine
française. Peut-être eût-il mieux valu de ne pas plus parler dans
les assemblées nationales, des colonies que de la religion, jusqu’à
ce que la révolution du continent eût été à son terme. Perfectionner
dans ces contrées lointaines le commissariat civil, adoucir les effets
du régime militaire, détruire insensiblement le préjugé des couleurs,
améliorer par des vues sages et des moyens progressifs le sort de
l’espèce humaine dans ces climats avares, etait peut-être la mesure
la plus convenable; mais la révolution a fait des progrès terribles sous
ce soleil brûlant. Saint-Domingue est aussi malheureux que les îles
des vents sont redevenues fidèles, et ses malheurs ne paraissent pas
rès de leur terme.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_427"></a>[427]</span></p>

<p>On examinera un jour s’il est des moyens de rattacher les colonies
à la France, par leur propre intérêt, c’est-à-dire, par la franchise
absolue de leur commerce avec nous, et une disposition générale des
droits perçus sur le commerce étranger, dans ces mêmes colonies. De
pareilles lois qui nous défendraient mieux que des escadres, demandent
d’être méditées.</p>

<p>Cette partie de l’intérêt national, doit être traitée séparément et
avec une forte sagesse; le comité est chargé de préparer en attendant
ce rapport, des mesures propres à diminuer les maux que cette belle
colonie souffre encore.</p>

<p class="center">DE LA FORCE PUBLIQUE DE L’INTÉRIEUR.</p>

<p>Elle se ressent partout de l’anarchie que règne. Là, elle délibère;
ici, elle agit au gré des passions. Disséminée dans toutes les sections
de l’empire, elle semble avoir une versatilité de principes et d’actions,
qui peut effrayer la liberté. Dans une ville, les citoyens riches et les
égoïstes, se font remplacer; défendre ses foyers, semble être encore
une corvée plutôt qu’un honneur, une charge plutôt qu’un droit. Dans
une autre cité, le service public frappe des artisans peu aisés ou des
ouvriers, qui ont besoin du repos de la nuit, pour le travail qui
alimente leur famille, il est plus que temps d’effacer ces lignes de
démarcation intolérable dans un régime libre. La nature seule a
décrit des différences; elle est dans les âges; les jeunes citoyens
depuis seize ans jusqu’à 25, sont les premiers que la patrie appelle;
moins occupés et plus disponibles, c’est à eux de voler aux premiers
dangers. Cette première force est-elle insuffisante (car il ne faut pas
penser à la défection) l’autre âge plus fort et plus sage, présente à la
société ses moyens, c’est l’âge de 25 à 35; la troisième classe sera de
35 à 45; la dernière réquisition doit frapper tout ce qui peut porter
les armes. Alors, la société appelle à son secours, tous ceux qui partagent
la souveraineté; une exception favorable se présente pour les
pères nourrissant leur famille du produit de leur travail. Une
exception contraire doit frapper les célibataires et les hommes veufs
sans enfans.</p>

<p>C’est à la législation et à la morale à flétrir ceux qui ne paient cette
dette ni à la nature ni à la République.</p>

<p>C’est ainsi qu’il convient aux Français, d’organiser le droit de
réquisition. Cet exemple est sorti des besoins de la liberté, dans les
terres américaines. La réquisition est l’appel de la patrie aux
citoyens; cet appel peut être fait par les généraux, quand la loi
le leur a confié momentanément, et dans les cas de guerre; cet appel
peut être fait par le pouvoir civil dans toutes les autorités constituées,
et encore plus par les assemblées nationales, qui sont à la fois pouvoir
civil, législatif et national.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_428"></a>[428]</span></p>

<p>Le comité a pensé qu’il devait présenter un mode uniforme, de
requérir la force publique dans toutes les parties de la République, et
de la part de toutes les autorités, afin que chaque fonctionnaire et
chaque citoyen, connaisse l’étendue de son pouvoir ou de son obligation....</p>

<p>D’ailleurs, on trouverait plusieurs avantages à borner ainsi la constitution
aux articles nécessaires.</p>

<p>(1ᵒ) Une plus grande espérance qu’elle sera acceptée par le peuple.</p>

<p>(2ᵒ) Une plus grande espérance encore que les citoyens ne demanderont
point si promptement, une réforme de la constitution.</p>

<p>(3ᵒ) On détruirait par cette seule résolution, même avant que la
constitution fût faite, une partie des espérances de nos ennemis, parce
qu’alors, ils commenceraient à croire que la Convention donnera une
constitution à la France, ce que jusqu’à présent ils ne croient pas.</p>

<p>En effet, il est difficile de ce tromper dans des articles généraux
importants, sur ce qui convient véritablement à la nation française, et
l’on n’a pas à craindre ces difficultés, cette presqu’ impossibilité d’exécution
qui, si on se livre aux détails, pourraient faire désirer la réforme
d’une constitution, d’ailleurs bien combinée.</p>

<p>On pourrait donc proposer de borner la constitution à ces articles
essentiels, dans le nombre desquels on sent que doit être compris le
mode de réformer la constitution, lorsqu’elle cessera de paraître, à la
majorité des citoyens, suffisante pour le maintien de leurs droits; et si
l’assemblée adoptait cet avis, elle chargerait quatre ou cinq de ses
membres, adjoints au comité de salut public de lui présenter un plan
de constitution, borné à ces seuls articles, et combiné de manière que
ces articles puissent être soumis immédiatement à la discussion.</p>

<p>Le travail de ce comité ne prendrait qu’une semaine, et l’assemblée
pourrait suivre ses discussions sur la constitution, car rien ne serait
plus facile que de placer dans ce plan, les points déjà arrêtés par la
Convention.</p>

<p>Ce travail même serait utile, quand même l’assemblée voudrait se
livrer ensuite à plus de details:</p>

<p>(1ᵒ) Parce qu’il en résulterait un meilleur ordre de discussions;</p>

<p>(2ᵒ) Parce qu’on aurait toujours alors, un moyen d’accélérer le
travail, selon que des circonstances impérieuses l’exigeraient. C’est
d’après cette idée simple que nous vous proposerons de décréter que la
Convention charge une commission, composée de cinq de ses membres,
adjoints au comité de salut public, de lui présenter dans le plus court
délai, un plan de constitution, réduit aux seuls article qu’il importe de
rendre irrévocables par les assemblées législatives, pour assurer à la
République son unité, son indivisibilité et sa liberté, et au peuple
l’exercice de tous ses droits.</p>

<p>Reprenons donc avec constance le travail de la constitution, et discutons-en
le petit nombre d’articles vraiment constitutionals, avec cette<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_429"></a>[429]</span>
sagesse qui n’exclut pas l’énergie, et avec ce talent qui ne flétrisse pas
les défiances.</p>

<p>Songez que le dernier article de la constitution sera le commencement
du traité de paix avec les puissances. Il leur tarde de savoir
avec qui elles peuvent traiter, quelle que soit la forme de notre
gouvernement....</p>

</div>

<p>There follows a strong attack upon the Federal idea,
showing the Committee to be definitely anti-Girondin in
its sociology.</p>

<div class="blockquote">

<p>Mais cette inscription sera-t-elle donc toujours mensongère? verra-t-on
sans cesse, dans le palais de l’unité, les fureurs de la discorde, et
44 mille petites républiques y agitant leurs dissensions par des représentans?...</p>

<p>Il faut qu’à votre voix, tous les Français se prononcent, que
l’égoïste et l’avare soient flétris par l’opinion, et punis dans leurs

bonheur pour vous, que dans le succès de la liberté, dans le rétablissement
de l’ordre, et dans l’affermissement des propriétés.</p>

<p>Voilà la base de toutes les sociétés politiques, et le législateur

marche, et le comité de surveillance retient les principaux auteurs de ce nouveau
complot. Malgré tant de surveillance, quelques soldats français, indignes de ce
nom, ont trahi leur devoir et sont allés grossir la horde des rebelles. Partout les
obstacles se multiplient; partout les administrations veulent régler les mouvemens
des troupes et les commissaires veulent faire les fonctions de généraux, des
communes arrêtent à leur gré des armes qui ont une autre destination, et c’est
ainsi que toutes les forces s’atténuent et que les brigands ont des succès.</p>

<p>Mais du moins les rives qui correspondent aux perfides de George III. sont
garanties. Les trois divisions commandées par le général Canclaux, qui occupent
les ports intermédiaires entre les Sables et Nantes, entretiennent la communication
entre ces deux villes, et contiennent les brigands à une certaine distance des
côtes.</p>

<p>La communication par terre, entre Nantes et Angers, est libre, on travaille à
rétablir la libre navigation de la Loire entre ces deux villes. Quelques bateaux
armés de canons sont préparés, et suffiront pour cette protection.</p>

<p>Déjà une victoire signalée vient de raviver toutes les espérances de la patrie.
A Saint-Mexent, l’artillerie et les approvisionnemens des révoltés sont le prix de
la première victoire signalée que les patriotes viennent de remporter.</p>
